48,Diasporas and Outsourcing: Evidence from oDesk and India,/item/diasporas-and-outsourcing-evidence-from-odesk-and-india,24 Oct 2012,"Diaspora-based exchanges have been important for centuries, but the online world reduces many of the frictions these networks solved. How do the Internet and diaspora networks connect? This study investigated the importance of Indian diaspora connections on the oDesk platforms for outsourcing. oDesk is the world's largest online labor market, processing $30 million per month in contracts as of May 2012. This research finds strong evidence that diasporas still matter and influence economic exchanges even when many frictions are minimized. In fact, the case study suggests more often than not that diaspora use increases as familiarity with the platform increases. This suggests a longer-term complementarity between diaspora networks and online tools that may aid the persistence of these networks. At the same time, the oDesk evidence also makes clear that the role of diaspora networks should not be overstated. While they contributed to India's success on oDesk, diaspora connections were clearly not a driving force in India becoming the top destination for oDesk contracts. Key concepts include: The frictions that online platforms like oDesk minimize are frictions that diaspora networks have historically been used to overcome. This makes their role for future economic exchanges uncertain. Diaspora connections still matter. Ethnic Indians working in countries outside of India are 32 percent (9 percentage points) more likely to choose a worker in India than non-ethnic Indians. Yet, even with the increased likelihood of outsourcing to India, diaspora connections played a very small role in India's rapid development on oDesk. In fact, diaspora connections appear to follow rather than lead the platform's development. Diaspora connections occur through the actions of many people in small ways and the extreme concentration of impact due to a few key people. Diasporas will continue to use online platforms in an effective manner, but diasporas will not be responsible for a country's overall success on the platform, at least in countries of moderate to large size.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing

51,Entrepreneurship and Urban Growth: An Empirical Assessment with Historical Mines,/item/entrepreneurship-and-urban-growth-an-empirical-assessment-with-historical-mines,29 Aug 2012,"Does entrepreneurship cause urban growth? Economists and policymakers often argue yes, but it is remarkable how little is known about what lies behind this relationship. This paper investigates the connection more closely using a link between historical mineral and coal deposits and modern entrepreneurship observed in US cities today. Because the process of bringing ores out of the earth is a capital-intensive operation that often benefits from large-scale operations, cities with a historical abundance of nearby mineral and coal mines developed industrial structures with systematically larger establishments and less entrepreneurship. These early industrial traits persisted long after the initial conditions faded through intergenerational transmissions, path dependency, and similar. Using this variation, the study finds the strong connection between a city's initial entrepreneurship and subsequent economic growth is still observed after removing the most worrisome endogeneity. This connection works primarily through lower employment growth of startups in cities that are closer to mines. Key concepts include: Entrepreneurship plays an important role in modern urban growth. Entrepreneurship is systematically related to local employment growth over the past three decades for American cities. The casual relationship behind this correlation, however, has been hard to discern due to endogeneity of entry decisions (can be biased upwards or downwards). Proximity to historical mines provided past benefits to cities. Indeed, cities may have been founded precisely to exploit these deposits. These initial conditions, however, created industrial legacies that are not conducive to entrepreneurship today. Looking at US cities from the 1970s onwards, cities built near historical mines in 1900 have larger establishments, less entry for entrepreneurial firms, and less urban growth. This is relationship is true even in industries that are not directly related to mining, such as trade, finance, and services. These effects also hold in many different regions of the US. Using this empirical link to past mines, the causal nature of entrepreneurship for city growth can be more accurately assessed. The link holds up very well, usually suggesting that the basic correlation is approximately right. There are some limits, however, that the paper discusses that leads to cautious conclusions. The primary mechanism behind the linkage of entrepreneurship to urban growth is that it creates in cities an up-or-out dynamic for firms.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing

53,Is India’s Manufacturing Sector Moving Away from Cities?,/item/is-indias-manufacturing-sector-moving-away-from-cities,19 Apr 2012,"One of the biggest challenges in development is urbanization. Within developing countries, nearly two billion people are expected to move from rural regions into cities in the next two decades. This paper closely examines the movement of economic activity in Indian manufacturing between urban and rural areas. The authors find that while the organized sector is becoming less urbanized, the unorganized sector is becoming more urbanized. This process has been most closely linked to greater urbanization changes in districts with high education levels; a second role is often evident for public infrastructure as well. On the whole, these urbanization changes have modestly improved the urban-rural allocation of industries within India's districts. Key concepts include: Much of the urbanization that is occurring is in the unorganized sector. Policies that take an inclusionary approach to the urban informal economy may be more successful in promoting local development and managing its strains than those focused only on the formal sector. Districts with better education and infrastructure have experienced a faster pace of urbanization, although higher urban-rural cost ratios cause movement out of urban areas. Observers have frequently noted the relatively slow pace of India's urbanization. Moreover, the movement of organized manufacturing sector plants to rural areas is surprising, given the relative youth of India's manufacturing sector. Continued investment in infrastructure and education, beyond their direct effects for Indian businesses, may also provide beneficial effects from an urbanization and spatial allocation perspective. The most urbanized states in terms of manufacturing employment are Delhi and Chandigarh at over 90 percent in 2000, with Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Punjab also above 60 percent. However, Bihar, Orissa, and Himachal Pradesh have urbanization rates of less than 20 percent for manufacturing employment.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing

56,"Carbon Tariffs: Impacts on Technology Choice, Regional Competitiveness, and Global Emissions",/item/carbon-tariffs-impacts-on-technology-choice-regional-competitiveness-and-global-emissions,22 Nov 2011,"Under current emissions regulation such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the Northeast US, imports entering the region fall outside the regulatory regime and incur no carbon costs. As a result, imports can compete within the carbon-regulated region with a new-found advantage, potentially altering the competitive balance between emissions-regulated and -unregulated firms. While implementing carbon tariffs—border adjustments— may appear to be a straightforward solution to this asymmetry, the potential for such a measure to be interpreted as a trade barrier, and thereby initiate a reciprocal tariff, has thus far stymied debate on the issue. This paper explores the impact of such border adjustments on firms' technology choice, regional competitiveness, and global emissions. The analysis shows that border adjustments (or lack thereof) play a vital role in determining firms' technology and production choices, both of which are fundamental operations management decisions that ultimately determine economic and environmental performance. Results have implications for each of the primary stakeholders: regulators making the policy decision regarding border adjustments; firms interested in understanding their competitiveness and location strategies under a border adjustment; and technology producers interested in assessing the potential impact of border adjustments on demand for cleaner technologies. Key concepts include: Border adjustments means tariffs on the carbon content of imported goods that would incur carbon costs if produced domestically. Emissions regulation in effect today is not currently supported by border adjustment mechanisms. This allows goods produced offshore to compete within the emissions-regulated market without incurring the carbon costs associated with local production. Emissions regulation without border adjustment limits the legislation's ability to impact global emissions. The border adjustment policy decision and firms' technology choices interact to fundamentally determine the nature of regional competitiveness, the risk of carbon leakage, and the potential for carbon regulation to achieve a reduction in global emissions. This paper raises important implications related to the role and feasibility of border adjustments in mitigating leakage effects that can result from current, uncoordinated emissions abatement efforts. While technology choice plays a minor role without a border adjustment, it fundamentally defines the nature of competitiveness when border adjustments are implemented.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing

Key concepts include: The concept of ""by-product synergy"" consists of taking the waste stream from one production process and using it to make a new product. Productively using waste instead of trashing it can cut costs by reducing disposal fees and opening up additional revenue streams through by-product sales. The greatest returns are realized when a company widens its scope to think strategically to consider waste processing as a joint-production process. In some cases, maximizing profit might mean, paradoxically, creating more waste.Closed for comment; 17 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing

During the study period, 66 percent of the country's antidumping cases targeted petrochemical imports, while steel imports were targeted only in 5 percent of the cases. Why did China's petrochemical and steel industries behave so differently in seeking trade protection? The answers put forward by researchers Regina Abrami (Harvard Business School) and Yu Zheng (University of Connecticut) point toward the structural nature of the industries themselves, and against arguments that antidumping actions in China have been driven by retaliation or national industrial strategy alone. Key concepts include: Existing patterns of antidumping investigations in China mainly reflect how firms may respond to economic challenges in the context of structural constraints. Rather than serving as a defense against global competition, strong local interests in China seem to be facilitating it. They do so by getting in the way of the kinds of industrial consolidations that seem necessary to wage successful battles through antidumping mechanisms. The research does not dismiss a role for economic or political interests as motivating factors, but does suggest that in their own right they cannot explain fully the patterns that exist. The research demonstrates that domestic business interest groups can influence state policy outcomes in China; that their ability to do so is closely related to resolution of collective action problems; and that Chinese industrial strategy is a far less coordinated political outcome than the increasingly popular idea of ""China Inc."" suggests.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing

Of course, tight geographic concentration comes with countervailing costs as firms compete for local inputs. In this paper, HBS professor William R. Kerr and coauthors study the impact of increased local concentration on incumbent firms by considering postwar Germany, when the fear of expropriation (or worse) in the wake of World War II prompted many machine tool firm owners to flee to western Germany, where they reestablished their firms. Key concepts include: Relocations significantly increased the likelihood of incumbent failure, which suggests that the costs of increased competition for local inputs dominated the potential benefits from agglomeration economies. By contrast, during the same postwar period, new start-up entrants—whose location choices were more opportunistic—were not associated with increased incumbent failure rates. The increased failure rates of incumbents in western Germany due to relocating firms was concentrated in regions where labor forces were constrained due to low inflows of expellees from eastern Germany. In regions with a significant inflow of expellees and favorable input conditions, there was no effect of relocations on incumbent firms' risk of failure. The relocation of the machine tool industry from eastern to western Germany was substantial. In total, a fifth of the industry present in eastern Germany migrated during a narrow window of 1949-1956, representing an 8 percent increase in total industry size for the receiving zones. These location choices were made under extreme duress, with little regard to existing business conditions across regions in western Germany. Upon arrival, the relocating firms substantially impacted local industrial conditions as they quickly regained much of their former production capacity.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing
61,Local Industrial Conditions and Entrepreneurship: How Much of the Spatial Distribution Can We Explain?,/item/local-industrial-conditions-and-entrepreneurship-how-much-of-the-spatial-distribution-can-we-explain,04 Dec 2008,"Some places, like Silicon Valley, seem almost magically entrepreneurial with a new start-up on every street corner. Other areas, like declining cities of the Rust Belt, appear equally starved of whatever local attributes make entrepreneurship more likely. Many academics, policymakers, and business leaders stress the importance of local conditions for explaining spatial differences in entrepreneurship and economic development. This paper uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau to characterize these entry relationships more precisely within the manufacturing sector. Key concepts include: Local costs and relevant natural advantages (e.g., coastal access, energy prices) are very important for new manufacturing start-ups. Manufacturing start-ups are particularly drawn to cities with suitable labor forces in terms of occupational distributions. This labor dependency holds across all sizes of start-ups. New start-ups are drawn to areas with smaller, more entrepreneurial suppliers. Local customers are less important for manufacturing startups. Measures of general entrepreneurial culture did not predict manufacturing entry well.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing

A new Web site—both a public service and a research tool—posts managers' data in real time, allowing a balanced view of industrial environmental performance. HBS professor Michael W.

Users of MapEcos can easily find detailed information on the environmental performance of facilities across the United States. Managers can monitor peer companies' environmental information as well as disclose information about their own facilities. The scholars use the site to examine what industrial facilities do and what the public at large is concerned about.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing
63,What Causes Industry Agglomeration? Evidence from Coagglomeration Patterns,/item/what-causes-industry-agglomeration-evidence-from-coagglomeration-patterns,23 May 2007,"Most industries exhibit some degree of geographic concentration. Although many theories attempt to explain this agglomeration, empirical tests of these theories are difficult as they all predict similar outcomes within individual industries. This study considers how industries coagglomerate—that is, which industry pairs locate together—to form a tractable analysis. The authors specifically study the relative importance of proximity to suppliers and customers, to firms using similar labor, and the sharing of ideas for explaining agglomeration. Key concepts include: In manufacturing, transport costs for goods, people, and ideas all still seem to matter. Given the remarkable decline of transportation costs over the 20th century, it is striking that transport costs remain so important. It is unclear how these results would extend to non-manufacturing industries. Services are costly to transport since they involve face-to-face interaction, and idea flows might take precedence in non-manufacturing industries.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing
64,From Manufacturing to Design: An Essay on the Work of Kim B. Clark,/item/from-manufacturing-to-design-an-essay-on-the-work-of-kim-b-clark,12 Apr 2007,"The interdisciplinary research of economist Kim Clark, former dean of Harvard Business School and now President of Brigham Young University-Idaho, occupies a unique place in management scholarship for three reasons. First, he tended to focus on little known and under-appreciated management groups such as manufacturing managers, product development managers, and product and process architects. Thus, he directly positioned himself outside the ""traditional"" management disciplines of strategy, finance, marketing, and organizational behavior. Second, he swam against the academic tide by recognizing the power of comparative and longitudinal field studies. Third, he sought frameworks beyond his own field in design theory, the engineering sciences, and finance. This paper reviews his research contributions over almost thirty years. Key concepts include: Throughout his career, Clark has brought fresh insights to old questions and opened up new territories of research. He helped to replace Frederick Taylor's scientific management principles with the dynamic concepts of continual learning and learning organizations. Clark showed how product development could be actively managed for greater efficiency and effectiveness. He developed a theory of the embedding of knowledge in organizations, which he used to explain why established firms often fail in the face of ""seemingly minor innovations."" He showed how changes in the modular structure of products and processes could bring about fundamental change in the structure of industries. Finally, in Clark's later works, he built bridges from design theory to user innovation, transaction- and knowledge-based theories of the firm, and strategy.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Manufacturing

What does cost transparency do, however, in customer-firm relationships, when firms voluntarily disclose their variable costs explicitly and directly to consumers? This is the question the authors examine in this paper. Results of several experiments indicate that one-way cost transparency enhances consumers' attraction to the brand, in turn increasing their willingness to buy. Overall, marketers can potentially improve both brand attraction and sales by revealing costs. Key concepts include: Relative to other marketing tactics, cost transparency might be an innovative and inexpensive way to build brand attraction and sales. Disclosing sensitive cost information appeals to consumers regardless of their prior relationship with a brand.

250,Price Coherence and Adverse Intermediation,/item/price-coherence-and-adverse-intermediation,17 Jan 2014,"In modern markets, buyers can often buy the same good or service directly from a seller, and through one or more intermediaries, all at the same exact price. Buyers respond by choosing whichever intermediary offers the greatest benefit - perhaps a rebate, some kind of ""points,"" or superior service. Importantly, buyers ignore the fees that intermediaries charge to sellers. The resulting outcomes can be distortionary and welfare-reducing. In particular, as intermediaries compete to attract buyers, they can set benefit levels so high that no net value is created and, sometimes, that buyers and seller would be jointly better off without intermediaries. The study examines six markets in which intermediaries are prominent: travel booking networks, credit and debit cards, insurance brokers and financial advisors, malls and marketplaces (such as Amazon Marketplace), cashback and rebate services, and search engine advertising. In each instance, a law, norm, intermediary policy, or similar rigidity prevents sellers from passing an intermediary's fees to the specific buyers who choose to use that intermediary. Key concepts include: Due to a market failure caused by the structure of the relationship between buyer, seller, and intermediary when buyers face a single price, intermediaries can thrive even when they offer little or no actual value. By offering benefits to buyers, at no direct charge to buyers, intermediaries cause excessive usage of their services: usage which then lets intermediaries extract significant fees from sellers, indeed beyond even the normal monopoly fees. Buyers ultimately pay for intermediaries' services via increased prices charged by sellers. But an individual buyer cannot escape the cost by declining the intermediary's service since he or she will pay the same price anyway. Competition among multiple intermediaries does not necessarily improve welfare. When intermediaries compete by offering larger benefits to buyers, greater competition can actually exacerbate the distortions and make things worse.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

252,"Mechanisms of Technology Re-Emergence and Identity Change in a Mature Field: Swiss Watchmaking, 1970-2008",/item/mechanisms-of-technology-re-emergence-and-identity-change-in-a-mature-field-swiss-watchmaking-1970-2008,06 Jan 2014,"According to most theories of technological change, old technologies tend to disappear when newer ones arrive. As this paper argues, however, market demand for old technologies may wane only to emerge again at a later point in time, as seems to be the case for products like Swiss watches, fountain pens, streetcars, independent bookstores, and vinyl records, which have all begun to claim significant market interest again. Looking specifically at watchmaking, the author examines dynamics of technology re-emergence and the mechanisms whereby this re-emergence occurs in mature industries and fields. Swiss watchmakers had dominated their industry and the mechanical watch movement for nearly two centuries, but their reign ended abruptly in the mid-1970s at the onset of the ""Quartz Revolution"" (also known as the ""Quartz Crisis""). By 1983, two-thirds of all watch industry jobs in Switzerland were gone. More recently, however, as the field has moved toward a focus on luxury, a ""re-coupling"" of product, organizational, and community identity has allowed master craftsmen to continue building their works of art. The study makes three main contributions: 1) It highlights the importance of studying technology-in-practice as a lens on viewing organizational and institutional change. 2) It extends the theorization of identity to products, organizations, and communities and embeds these within cycles of technology change. 3) It suggests the importance of understanding field-level change as tentative and time-bound: This perspective may allow deeper insights into the mechanisms that propel emergence, and even re-emergence, of seemingly ""dead"" technologies and industries. (Read an interview with Ryan Raffaelli about his research.) Key concepts include: The value of some products may go beyond pure functionality to embrace non-functional aspects that can influence consumer buying behaviors. Introducing a new technology is not always the only way to get ahead of the curve when older technologies or industries appear to be reaching the end of their life. Industries that successfully re-emerge are able to redefine their competitive set - the group of organizations upon which they want to compete and the value proposition that they send to the consumer. There is significant interplay among community, organization, and product identities. Swiss watches—as well as fountain pens, streetcars, independent bookstores and vinyl records—are all examples of technologies once considered dead that have rematerialized to claim significant market interest. For Swiss watchmakers, ""who we are"" (as a community) and ""what we do"" (as watch producers) were mutually constitutive and may have been a potent force in the processes that sought re-coupling in the face of the de-coupling precipitated by technological change. Although new or discontinuous technologies tend to displace older ones, legacy technologies can re-emerge, coexist with, and even come to dominate newer technologies. Core to this process is the creation—and recreation—of product, organization, and community identities that resonate with the re-emergence of markets for legacy technologies. Substantial economic change may not be contained only within organizational or industry boundaries, but also extend outward to include broader forces related to field-level change.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

As customer acquisition costs continue to rise, managing customer churn has become critically important for the profitability of companies. This paper provides a novel method for determining which customers to target in order to maximize the profit of a retention campaign. The authors developed a binary classification method that uses a gain/loss matrix, which incorporates the gain of targeting and retaining the most valuable churners and the cost of incentives to the targeted customers. Results show that this approach leads to far more profitable retention campaigns than the traditional churn modeling approaches. In addition, the additional profits come at no cost for companies. The implementation of the retention campaign is unchanged, only the composition and size of the target group changes compared to traditional approaches. Key concepts include: The authors describe a new method of customer retention that leads to substantial improvements for companies with no additional implementation cost.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

263,Improving Store Liquidation,/item/improving-store-liquidation,24 May 2013,"Store liquidation, defined as the time-constrained divestment of retail stores through an in-store sale of inventory, is a critical aspect of the retail industry for both defunct and going concerns. Store liquidation is important for firms and investors, affecting everything from retailer performance to how retailers are financed and how investors are compensated. Further, store liquidation is fundamental to innovation in the retail sector, since extracting value from defunct stores and firms is a key step in the process of creative destruction. In this paper, the authors introduce methods for increasing the efficiency of store liquidations operated by retail asset disposition firms, and they thus extend management science techniques to a consequential problem that has not yet been addressed by the literature. These methods were developed through a collaboration with GBG, a prominent liquidator, during the liquidation of over $3B of inventory. Key concepts include: This paper introduces a method for improving the efficiency of store liquidations, i.e., for increasing the net orderly liquidation value (NOLV) of retail stores, with a focus on liquidations conducted by asset disposition firms. The method comprises a dynamic program that informs markdown, inventory, and store closing decisions as well as a demand forecasting model. In each of three recent applications, the authors show that their method provided a significant improvement over prior practice.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods
264,Marketplace or Reseller?,/item/marketplace-or-reseller,16 May 2013,"Intermediaries can often choose to operate as a marketplace, as a reseller, or as a hybrid having some products offered under each of the two different modes. For example, Alibaba.com, eBay.com, Premium Outlets, and Simon Malls act as marketplaces, in which suppliers sell directly to buyers via a platform. In contrast, retailers like 7-Eleven, Eastbay.com, Lowes, and Zappos.com resell the products they purchase from suppliers to buyers. A hybrid mode is also possible: For example, the largest electronics retailer in the United States, Best Buy, has taken a step towards the marketplace mode by allowing Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft to launch their own ministores within Best Buy stores. What economic tradeoffs drive an intermediary to adopt one mode over the other, or both? In this paper, the authors provide a new style of modeling intermediaries' strategic positioning decisions and a theory of which products an intermediary should offer in each mode. They also present a guide to how intermediaries should optimally position themselves between the two different modes. Managerial implications not only apply to an intermediary choosing between positioning itself as a pure reseller or a pure marketplace, but to hybrid modes in which the intermediary needs to determine how many products (and in the case of diverse products, which products) to offer in each mode. Key concepts include: A key distinction between marketplaces and resellers is the allocation of control rights between independent suppliers and the intermediary over non-contractible decisions (prices, advertising, customer service, responsibility for order fulfillment, etc.) pertaining to the products being sold. At the most basic level, a marketplace benefits from allowing suppliers to exploit their local information, whereas a reseller can exploit its own local information. Intermediaries should choose the marketplace mode for the following types of products: (1) products for which suppliers have a significant information advantage about the best way to market products relative to the intermediary; (2) products whose prices and marketing activities have limited spillovers on other products; (3) long-tail products; and (4) products provided by late stage ventures. On the other hand, intermediaries should choose the reseller mode for the following types of products: (1) products for which the intermediary has an information advantage about the best way to market products relative to suppliers; (2) products whose prices and marketing activities have significant spillovers on other products; (3) short-tail products; and (4) products provided by early stage ventures.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

Geoffrey Jones takes a historical approach and focuses on influential figures who created new categories of natural and organic food, agriculture, and beauty products over the course of the twentieth century. At first these pioneering entrepreneurs, often motivated by ideological or religious convictions, faced little consumer demand for ""green"" products and little consumer knowledge of what they entailed. The creation of new categories thus involved a lengthy process with three overlapping waves of entrepreneurship. First, the diffusion of ideas through publishing, and promotion of research and education, engaged many entrepreneurs. They were, in effect, making the ideological case for natural products, and providing the basis for them to be made available. Second, entrepreneurs engaged in the creation of industry associations which could advocate, as well as give the nascent industry credibility and create standards. Finally, entrepreneurial ventures established retail stores, supply and distribution networks, and created brands. Key concepts include: Entrepreneurial cognition and motivation frequently lay in individual, and very local, experiences, combined with strong global visions about the need for environmental sustainability. There was a notable international transfer of ideas and concepts. Exposure to Asia, or an imagined Asia, was a significant influence on many pioneering entrepreneurs. Many individual entrepreneurs suffered from personal illnesses which appeared to have motivated their subsequent careers. A significant sub-set of the influential historical figures were articulate in expressing strong religious convictions. These entrepreneurs believed that business could and should be used as a vehicle to preserve and protect the natural environment. By the 1990s, entrepreneurs encouraged a much wider range of businesses to enter the natural categories, some genuinely, but others seeking to green wash conventional businesses. This created confusion and skepticism in consumer minds. There were also legitimacy issues caused by growing scale.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

276,Platform Competition Under Partial Belief Advantage,/item/platform-competition-under-partial-belief-advantage,16 Feb 2012,"In platform competition in a two-sided market, a platform's ability to attract consumers depends not only on the consumers' beliefs regarding its quality, but also on consumers' beliefs regarding the platform's ability to attract the other side of the market. For example, in the market for smart-phones the recent introductions of Apple's iPhone 4S with the improved operating system, and Samsung's Galaxy II with the improved Android 4, open a new round in the competition between the two platforms. The ability of each platform to attract users depends not only on its perceived quality, but also on users' beliefs regarding the number new applications developed for the platform. Likewise, the ability to attract application developers to the platform depends on their beliefs regarding the number of users that will join the platform. In a competitive market, some platforms may enjoy more favorable beliefs of the market (about their ability to attract ``the other side) than other platforms. Such a belief advantage may be source of a competitive advantage. In this paper, the authors look at how the belief advantage helps the platform to compete in the market, and also how a platform may create the belief advantage. The authors find that the degree of the platform's belief advantage affects its decision regarding its business model (whether to subsidize buyers or sellers), as well as the access fees and the size of the platform. Moreover, the paper looks into the optimal advertising strategy that leads to creating belief advantage. This paper contributes to scholarship on economics and business strategy. Key concepts include: The advantaged platform can win the market even if it offers a lower quality than the disadvantaged platform, because of its ability to exploit its beliefs advantage. It is also possible for the disadvantaged platform to win if it offers substantially higher quality.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

For retailers that can react quickly enough, this upheaval is survivable. But those slow to see the tsunami wave on the horizon stand to be swept away, according to professors Rajiv Lal and José B. Alvarez. Key concepts include: Retailing generally is at a tipping point, with category killers being the first significant casualties. Online competitors are making retail stores, which spent much of the last decade adding floor space, less productive. The impact of emerging technologies, expanding price and assortment transparency, and the increasing amount of excess retail space has created similar challenges for all mass-market retailers. Physical stores can compete by emphasizing instant gratification, unique shopping experiences, and customized support.Closed for comment; 18 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods
281,"Reviews, Reputation, and Revenue: The Case of Yelp.com",/item/reviews-reputation-and-revenue-the-case-of-yelp-com,04 Oct 2011,"In just six years, Yelp.com has managed to crowdsource 20 million reviews of restaurants and other services by creating and leveraging an impressive social network of people who enjoy writing reviews. But can a bunch of amateur opinionators working for free really transform the restaurant industry, where heavily marketed chains and highly regarded professional critics have long had a stronghold? To answer this question, HBS professor Michael Luca combined Yelp reviews with revenues for every restaurant that operated in Seattle, WA at any point between 2003 and 2009. Applying a new method to tease out the causal effect of reviews (separate from the effect of underlying quality), the study shows that a one-star increase on Yelp leads to a 5 to 9 percent increase in revenue. Yet Yelp doesn't work for all restaurants. Chain restaurants —which already spend heavily on branding —are unaffected by changes in their Yelp ratings. This suggests that consumer reviews present a new way of learning in the Internet age, and are fast becoming a substitute for traditional forms of reputation. Key concepts include: Online consumer review websites provide more information to consumers than was previously thought to be cost-effective. By relying on user-generated content, Yelp is able to review more products than traditional media such as newspaper reviews. More than 70 percent of Seattle restaurants are on Yelp. The impact of consumer reviews depends on the existing reputation of a company or product. Consumer reviews are effective overall, but ineffective when a product has a firmly established reputation (such as a chain restaurant). Consumer reviews provide a substitute for more traditional forms of marketing. Other forms of reputation such as chain affiliation may become less influential as websites like Yelp continue to gain traction. Evidence suggests that this pattern is already emerging. Consumers rely on simple metrics such as the average rating and the number of reviews, and are more trusting of reviews that are written by ""elite"" reviewers (as identified by Yelp).Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods
282,Managing Political Risk in Global Business: Beiersdorf 1914-1990,/item/managing-political-risk-in-global-business-beiersdorf-1914-1990,16 Aug 2011,"After the outbreak of World War 1, management of political risk became a central concern for firms, especially those operating internationally. These risks were on many levels, from expropriation to exchange controls and other economic policies. German firms, which had flourished during the second industrial revolution of the late nineteenth century, and enthusiastically expanded internationally, found themselves especially exposed to such risks. Focusing on one such firm, Beiersdorf, a German-based pharmaceutical and skin care company (and, during the Nazi years, a so-called Jewish business), the authors examine corporate strategies of political risk management during the twentieth century, especially the volatile years of Nazi Germany. The history of Beiersdorf highlights areas of managerial discretion. Faced by the worst of all worlds, the firm survived and was able, albeit at great cost, to rebuild its business. Key concepts include: The historical case of the German multinational Beiersdorf, the maker of the global skin care brand Nivea, is used to explore the growth of host and home country political risk in the twentieth century. The firm had its international factories and trademarks expropriated during World War 1, and again after World War 2, and as a Jewish firm faced great difficulties in its home economy during the Nazi era 1933-1945. Beiersdorf pursued several management strategies in response to growing risk. In Nazi Germany, it removed its Jewish management, and partly adapted its marketing message to the regime's ideology. It survived. Internationally, after World War 1 the firm developed an elaborate organizational structure designed to avoid future expropriations. It transferred international businesses to trusted associates. This had short-term success, but in the longer term it did not prevent the loss of factories and the Nivea trademark. After World War 2 Beiersdorf needed to spend decades rebuilding the fragmented Nivea brand. It only recovered ownership of the brand in the United States and Great Britain in 1973 and 1992, respectively.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

But for retailers offering the deals through the site, does the publicity compensate for the deep hit to profit margins? This paper sets out to help small businesses decide whether it makes sense to offer discount vouchers. Research was conducted by Harvard Business School professor Ben Edelman, Business Economics PhD candidate Scott Duke Kominers, and by Sonia Jaffe of the Harvard University Department of Economics. Key concepts include: For retailers, discount vouchers provide price discrimination, letting merchants reach customers who know about the business, but wouldn't ordinarily go there without a discount. These vouchers also benefit merchants through advertising, simply by informing consumers of a merchant's existence via e-mail. For some merchants, the benefits of offering discount vouchers are sharply reduced if individual customers buy multiple vouchers. As a marketing tool, discount vouchers are likely to be more effective for businesses that are relatively unknown and have low marginal costs.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

The reason? Professor José Alvarez says retailers need to see customers as partners, not transactions. Key concepts include: Most retailers are at a very basic level in using loyalty programs, and many customers see the programs as punitive. Successful retailers connect with customers via loyalty programs at three levels starting with an introduction, followed by a retailer-initiated communication, and finally with customer- or retailer-initiated feedback loops. Retailers should ask themselves, How do I create a partnership with the consumer? Data collected from these programs can help merchants make smarter decisions on everything from where to open a new store to pulling the plug on a fading brand.Closed for comment; 18 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

286,"Search Diversion, Rent Extraction and Competition",/item/search-diversion-rent-extraction-and-competition,16 Jun 2011,"Retailers, search engines, shopping malls and other intermediaries often deliberately design their physical layouts or e-commerce sites in order to divert customers' attention away from the products they were initially looking for, with hopes that they'll buy a bunch of other products, too. This paper explores various incentives for so-called ""search diversion"" in a couple of scenarios—when stores internalize their affiliation decisions with intermediaries, and when competition is introduced among intermediaries. Research was conducted by Andrei Hagiu of Harvard Business School and Bruno Jullien of the Toulouse School of Economics. Key concepts include: If an intermediary cannot price-discriminate among several stores, it can use search diversion to reduce the variance of store profits—thus improving its rent extraction power. When stores affiliate with multiple intermediaries but consumers affiliate with only one, the incentives to divert search are reduced. But when consumers affiliate with multiple intermediaries and stores affiliate with only one, intermediary competition may exacerbate search diversion incentives. The broad implication of this paper is that competition may lead to intermediation design decisions that go against customer preferences in favor of decisions that favor third-party sellers or advertisers.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

288,The ‘IKEA Effect’: When Labor Leads to Love,/item/the-ikea-effect-when-labor-leads-to-love,13 Apr 2011,"Companies increasingly involve customers in the design and assembly of products, from Converse allowing customers to design their own shoes to IKEA asking customers to assemble their own furniture. In this paper researchers Michael I. Norton (Harvard Business School), Daniel Mochon (University of California at San Diego), and Dan Ariely (Duke) use the ""IKEA Effect"" to explain the increase in valuation we place on products we build ourselves. The researchers discuss the implications of the IKEA Effect for marketing managers and organizations more generally. Key concepts include: Successful assembly of products—no matter how amateurish—leads consumers to value them over and above the value that arises from merely purchasing a product. Labor increases valuation of completed products not just for consumers who profess an interest in ""do-it-yourself"" projects, but even for those who express a preference for buying preassembled products. Successful completion is an essential component for the link between labor and liking to emerge; participants who were not permitted to finish their creations did not show an increase in willingness-to-pay. The marketing challenge lies in convincing consumers to engage in the kinds of labor that will lead them to value products more highly, especially given their general aversion to such pursuits. The overvaluation that occurs as a result of the IKEA Effect has implications for organizations as a contributor to two key organizational pitfalls: sunk cost effects and the ""not invented here"" syndrome.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

Its series of mistakes and some bad luck are captured in a new case by Harvard Business School marketing professor John A. Quelch. Key concepts include: Entering the US, Tesco deserves credit for creating a neighborhood market approach—emphasizing fresh produce and meats, and good quality but value-priced prepared meals. By not partnering or hiring local executives, Tesco missed the opportunity to learn more about the habits and needs of target customers. Tesco rightly aimed to scale the concept as soon as possible so that fixed overhead investments in its own distribution centers could be spread across a larger number of stores. Perhaps Tesco's original rollout plan was too ambitious, with executives assuming that the company would get everything right on the first try. Tesco has listened to its customers, learned from its mistakes, and made appropriate midcourse corrections.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

A new paper investigates how and whether a customer's assumptions about future supplier performance will affect the likelihood that the customer will order from that supplier in the future. Research, based on data from apparel manufacturer Hugo Boss, was conducted by Nathan Craig and Ananth Raman of Harvard Business School, and Nicole DeHoratius of the University of Portland. Key concepts include: Two key measures of supplier performance include ""consistency"", which is the likelihood that a company will continue to keep items in stock and meet demand, and ""recovery"", which is the likelihood that a company will deliver on time in spite of past stock-outs. Improvements in consistency and recovery are associated with increases in orders from retail customers. Increasing the level of service may lead to an increase in orders, even when the service level is already nearly perfect.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

This observation raises interesting questions for psychologists regarding the effects of luxury. What psychological consequences do luxury goods have on people? In this paper, the authors argue that luxury goods can activate the concept of self-interest and affect subsequent cognition. The argument involves two key premises: Luxury is intrinsically linked to self-interest, and exposure to luxury can activate related mental representations affecting cognition and decision-making. Two experiments showed that exposure to luxury led people to think more about themselves than others. Key concepts include: Luxury does not necessarily induce people to be ""nasty"" toward others but rather causes them to be less concerned about or considerate toward others. Experiment 1 showed that when primed with luxury, people are more likely to endorse self-interested business decisions (profit maximization), even at the expense of others. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that exposure to luxury is likely to activate self-interest but not the tendency to harm others. Exposure to luxury goods may activate a social norm that it is appropriate to pursue interests beyond a basic comfort level, even at the expense of others. It may be this activated social norm that affects people's judgment and decision-making. Alternatively, exposure to luxury may directly increase people's personal desire, causing them to focus on their own benefits such as prioritizing profits over social responsibilities.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

Of these users, 40 percent show a strong ""keeping up with the Joneses"" behavior, increasing sales by 5 percent. ""High-status"" users are more likely to not purchase something that others have bought.

Business History Review coeditor Walter A. Friedman discusses the publication's recent themed issue on salesmanship. Key concepts include: Scholarly books on the history of salespeople began to appear more frequently beginning in the 1990s, with more recent work comparing 20th-century salespeople in Europe with those in the United States. In addition to comparative trends, research in this area attempts to place the story of the salesperson within the broader themes of history. Salespeople played a positive role displacing old products and promoting innovation. A strong sales force could also create a barrier to entry, as in the case of IBM.

304,Crafting Integrated Multichannel Retailing Strategies,/item/crafting-integrated-multichannel-retailing-strategies,29 May 2009,"The past fifteen years has been a period of rapid growth in the practice of multichannel retailing, mirroring the rise of the Internet as a nearly ubiquitous tool that firms use to interact with customers. More than 80 percent of a broad cross-section of U.S. retailers now report that they sell merchandise through multiple channels. This practice seems to be on the cusp of a new era in which firms start demanding even more from their investments, with particular emphasis being given to financial performance in light of the current economic crisis. These circumstances present a great opportunity both to firms that are looking to gain a competitive advantage through multichannel retailing and to researchers who are interested in helping them make more informed decisions. This article provides a broad discussion of these issues, synthesizes current knowledge, and suggests directions for future research. Key concepts include: The ability of the multichannel marketers to discover, develop, and exploit fully the potential synergies among multiple channels may depend on the degree of commitment to the new channels. Commitment is likely to depend on early results. Use caution in evaluating the effectiveness of a multichannel retailing program on the basis of short-term results alone. The effects of opening a new channel can be multi-faceted, and the benefits from embarking on a multichannel strategy can take time to develop. Over time, new organizational forms may emerge as the potential for new channels becomes clearer.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

310,Making the Decision to Franchise (or not),/item/making-the-decision-to-franchise-or-not,28 Jul 2008,"Owners operating outlets across multiple markets have a variety of organizational models to choose from, including franchising. The decision is one of the most important they will make. A new Harvard Business School study looks at how 420 convenience store chains organized to serve diverse customers. Key concepts include: Even firms that have a standardized business face the challenge of serving customers with different preferences and behaviors when that model is stretched across multiple markets. By choosing to franchise, the firm minimizes exposure to risk in a relatively unfamiliar market; as a tradeoff, it also gives up some measure of control. Chains that don't franchise employ fewer corporate and supervisory staff relative to the number of store-level employees. Early evidence from ongoing research indicates that unit sales are lower for firms that expand into multiple markets without franchising or providing some incentive system for local managers.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

312,Testing Strategy with Multiple Performance Measures Evidence from a Balanced Scorecard at Store24,/item/testing-strategy-with-multiple-performance-measures-evidence-from-a-balanced-scorecard-at-store24,22 May 2008,"To what extent do balanced scorecards provide useful information for testing and validating an organization's strategy? Numerous case studies of balanced scorecard implementations document their use in translating organizational strategies to objectives and measures, communicating strategic objectives to employees, evaluating the performance of business units, and aligning the incentives of employees across business units and functions. There has been comparatively little research, however, on the potential learning and feedback role of balanced scorecards. Analyzing balanced scorecard data from Store24—a privately held convenience store retailer in New England—during the implementation of an innovative but ultimately unsuccessful strategy, this study investigates whether, when, and how information about problems with the firm's strategy was captured in the multiple performance measures of its balanced scorecard. Key concepts include: Store24's balanced scorecard contained useful and timely information for detecting problems in its strategy. The results also suggest that Store24 executives eventually learned about problems with the strategy despite a lack of reliance on such formal analysis. Analysis of the balanced scorecard could have yielded more timely information as well as more detail on why the strategy was not working as planned. Multiple measures in a balanced scorecard might systematically be used to test how well different drivers of performance are working to achieve strategic objectives and superior financial performance.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

Such ""market-type dispersion"" is likely to compromise the headquarters' ability to control its stores for two reasons: Relative differences in local conditions make it difficult to monitor a store manager's behavior, and a chain with wide-ranging customer bases will have a harder time serving its customers and will need to rely more heavily on store managers' ability to adapt to local needs. This study identifies market-type dispersion as a factor that is systematically related to firms' organizational design choices. The results may help managers and consultants who deal with control challenges related to a chain's geographic expansion into different markets. Key concepts include: Chains experiencing higher levels of variation in customer demands across different locations are more likely to increase delegation and the provision of incentives through the organizational design choice of franchising. Stores are more likely to be franchised when their location characteristics are more divergent from the most prevalent location characteristics of the chain as a whole. Non-franchisor chains with higher levels of such market-type dispersion tend to decentralize operations to a greater extent. It is also possible that they provide higher variable pay.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

318,Modeling Expert Opinions on Food Healthiness: A Nutrition Metric,/item/modeling-expert-opinions-on-food-healthiness-a-nutrition-metric,18 Mar 2008,"Despite an increased standard of living in the United States and other developed countries, health problems attributable to poor nutrition persist in part due to consumers' inability to translate the dietary advice of nutrition experts into anything actionable. Citing the improvement of public health as a primary objective, numerous studies have highlighted the need for a nutritional scoring system that is both comprehensive in its coverage of food products and easily understood by consumers. In this paper the researchers advance this objective by proposing a nutrition metric that is based on the current views of leading experts in the field. The metric can be used to score any food or beverage for which several component nutrient quantities are known. Key concepts include: This model encompasses the factors that matter most to the professional judgment of nutrition experts. Previous models focusing solely on either positive or negative nutrients have omitted critical information that experts take into account when assessing a food's healthiness. This model could be used to generate healthiness ratings that are displayed on or near food and beverage labels, allowing consumers to make more informed choices about which products to purchase and consume.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

Answers may include missing information about the profitability of these crops, lack of access to the necessary capital to make the switch possible, lack of infrastructure necessary to bring the crops to export outlets, high risk of the export markets, lack of human capital necessary to adopt successfully a new agricultural technology, and misperception by researchers and policymakers about the true profit opportunities and risk of crops grown for export markets. Ashraf and colleagues conducted an experimental trial with DrumNet, a social enterprise of Pride Africa, a nongovernmental organization, to evaluate whether a package of services can help farmers adopt, finance, and market export crops, and thus earn more income. This experiment was motivated by a recent push in development to build sustainable interventions that help complete missing markets. Key concepts include: Researchers found positive but not overwhelming one-year impacts from DrumNet. DrumNet leads to more farmers growing export crops, increasing their production and lowering their marketing costs. While there was no statistically significant impact on income for the full sample of farmers, first-time growers of export-oriented crops experienced a statistically and economically significant increase in income. The epilogue to this project is more dismal. Due to DrumNet's lack of compliance with European export requirements, farmers were forced to undersell and thus default on their loans. The implication is that farmers may not be adopting export crops because of the risk of the export market.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods
320,"Radical Design, Radical Results",/item/radical-design-radical-results,19 Feb 2008,"Consumers appear increasingly willing to make purchase decisions based upon their emotions about a product—how it looks, or sounds, or makes them feel using it. But the traditional design process based on user experience goes only so far in creating radical innovation. Harvard Business School visiting scholar Roberto Verganti is exploring the new world of ""design-driven innovation."" Key concepts include: Innovative product design is risky, but provides competitive advantage to companies that understand how a product ""speaks"" to customers. Little theory exists to point the way for companies that want to create a successful design strategy beyond the traditional user-driven design process. Companies often adopt one of three design strategies: launch and see, see and launch, or wait and see. Innovators may often be in the see and launch category.

322,"The “Fees → Savings” Link, or Purchasing Fifty Pounds of Pasta",/item/the-fees-savings-link-or-purchasing-fifty-pounds-of-pasta,20 Nov 2007,"Discount membership clubs have a large and growing presence in retail—one recent survey reported that Costco sells to 1 in every 11 people in the United States and Canada, and warehouse clubs are estimated to be a $120 billion industry today in the United States alone. As a result, many people have had the experience of entering one of these popular clubs and leaving hours later with more goods than can fit in their car. One rational reason for such behavior is that membership clubs do offer lower prices than other retailers. However, Norton and Lee offer a counterintuitive explanation for such buying behavior. They propose that the presence of membership fees alone—independent of the actual savings on any given product—can lead consumers to infer a ""fees → savings"" link, leading them to spend more than they otherwise would to capitalize on these perceived ""great deals."" Norton and Lee explore this phenomenon by setting up their own ""membership clubs"" and comparing profits across stores with varying membership fees. Key concepts include: Consumers behave irrationally in response to membership fees. When stores charge membership fees, consumers infer a ""fees → savings"" link due to their belief that stores that charge fees do so because they offer better prices. The presence of fees leads to increased spending. Consumers in the study were more likely to express a desire to shop at stores that charged fees than those that did not, even when products and savings were similar. With exceptions, there may be a curvilinear relationship between fees and savings: fees that are too low serve as a hook to make people pay more later; medium fees indicate good prices and decent quality and service; and high fees signal exclusivity and high prices.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

Consumers use different approaches to buying things they want (pizza) versus items they should buy (salad). In their research on online grocery-buying habits and DVD rentals, Harvard Business School's Katy Milkman and Todd Rogers, along with Professor Max Bazerman, provide insights on the want-should conflict and the implications for managers in areas such as demand forecasting, consumer spending habits, and effective store layout. Key concepts include: People often behave as if they possess multiple selves with different, competing interests—the ""want-self"" versus the ""should-self."" The want-self demands instant gratification while the should-self looks to longer-term interest. Online grocery shoppers order healthier groceries when ordering for delivery in the distant future (i.e., 5 days from now) than when ordering for delivery tomorrow. Grocery stores that locate the produce section (""should"" buy) near the entrance have this figured out.

Providing evidence from a field study of an online grocer, this research shows that people act as if they will be increasingly virtuous the further into the future they project. Researchers examined how the length of delay between when an online grocery order is completed and when it is delivered affects what consumers order. They find that consumers purchase more ""should"" (healthy) groceries such as vegetables and less ""want"" (unhealthy) groceries such as ice cream the greater the delay between order completion and order delivery. The results have implications for public policy, supply chain managers, and models of time discounting. Key concepts include: Consumers spend less and order a higher percentage of ""should"" items and a lower percentage of ""want"" items the further in advance of delivery they place a grocery order. Encouraging people to order their groceries up to 5 days in advance of consumption could influence the healthfulness of the foods that people consume. Similarly, asking students in schools to select their lunches up to a week in advance could considerably increase the healthfulness of the foods they elect to eat. Online and catalog retailers that offer a range of goods as well as different delivery options might be able to improve their demand forecasting by understanding these findings.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

333,Adding Bricks to Clicks: The Effects of Store Openings on Sales through Direct Channels,/item/adding-bricks-to-clicks-the-effects-of-store-openings-on-sales-through-direct-channels,12 Feb 2007,"Consider a retailer who operates both brick-and-mortar stores and direct channels such as direct mail catalogs and an Internet Web site. What effect does the opening of a new retail store have on direct channel sales in the retail trading area surrounding the store? Does the existence of more opportunities for consumer contact with the brand increase the retailer's direct sales, or does intra-brand, inter-channel competition erode the retailer's direct sales? Does consumer response to the retailer's brand evolve over time, perhaps as consumers go through some process of trial-and-error learning about the relative merits of stores and direct channels, or is the impact of the new store relatively discrete? Does the answer depend on whether consumers in the retail trading area have had the opportunity for previous experience with the brand's stores? This research used a proprietary longitudinal dataset from a multichannel retailer to understand what happens and to probe the implications for channel management strategy. Key concepts include: Adding a physical retail store to existing direct sales channels increases firm sales in the long run, as sales from the new store are incremental to sales from direct channels, which show little long term damage from channel competition. Adding channels produces both cannibalizing and complementary effects which operate in tandem and vary over time. Cannibalization occurs in the short term following the addition of a new channel, while complementarity takes time to manifest itself. Retail store openings cannibalize direct channel sales in the short term if physical stores do not already exist in the retail trading area, but produce complementary effects which overcome the losses from cannibalization in the long run. Our results suggest the underlying consumer shopping behavior driving this result. The opening of a retail store may induce some existing direct channel customers to switch their purchases to the retail store; simultaneously, new customers are attracted to the direct channels, perhaps due to a branding effect stemming from the publicity surrounding the new store which makes customers more aware of and more comfortable with the firm's direct channel operations. Use caution extrapolating these results to other retailers. This study involved only store openings by a single retailer with a well established and respected brand into markets where the retailer did not previously have stores. Direct retailers with less established brands may benefit even more than this retailer from branding effects by opening a new store.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Consumer Packaged Goods

371,"Historical Origins of Environmental Sustainability in the German Chemical Industry, 1950s-1980s",/item/historical-origins-of-environmental-sustainability-in-the-german-chemical-industry-1950s-1980s,20 Sep 2013,"This paper examines the emergence of environmental strategies in the chemical industry between the 1950s and the 1980s. German chemical firms have been hailed as ""eco-pioneers"" in this regard, but this study demonstrates that initially the leading chemical companies of both Germany and the United States followed a similar approach to societal concerns about environmental pollution. Both German and American firms suggested that pollution incidents and complaints were a matter for local responses, tailored to specific settings, and should be considered primarily as nuisances rather than as environmental or health hazards. By the 1970s, however, the evolution of environmental strategies in the German chemical industry diverged greatly from that of the United States. This working paper explores how and why by examining the strategies of two prominent German chemical companies, Bayer and Henkel. The German firms diverged from their American counterparts in using public relations strategies not only to contain fallout from criticism of their pollution impact, but also to create opportunities for changes in corporate culture to encourage sustainability. While the US chemical industry remained defensive and focused on legal compliance, there was a greater proactivity among the German firms. The study stresses the importance of the regional embeddedness of Bayer and Henkel in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which made their reputations especially vulnerable to criticism. A new generation of corporate leaders also perceived that more reactive strategies were needed to fulfill societal expectations. They were savvy enough to understand that investing in environmental sustainability could provide an opportunity to create value for the firm, and that self-identifying as eco-pioneers had commercial as well as reputational benefits, provided that the image reflected genuine policies and processes. Key concepts include: Leading German chemical companies have been regarded and self-identified as ""eco-pioneers,"" but before the 1970s their environmental strategies were broadly similar to their U.S. counterparts. Subsequently the German firms became more proactive in their environmental strategies. The regional embeddedness of Bayer and Henkel in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia emerges as an important determinant of their emergent green strategies. The firms had deep reputational stakes invested in their region and were highly exposed to criticism of their environmental impact. Corporate leaders of Henkel and Bayer were early movers in understanding that investing in environmental sustainability could provide an opportunity to create value for their firms.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Chemical
372,The New Face of Chinese Industrial Policy: Making Sense of Anti-Dumping Cases in the Petrochemical and Steel Industry,/item/the-new-face-of-chinese-industrial-policy-making-sense-of-anti-dumping-cases-in-the-petrochemical-and-steel-industry,30 Nov 2010,"The researchers set out to explain differences in China's antidumping actions against importers in the petrochemical and steel industries. During the study period, 66 percent of the country's antidumping cases targeted petrochemical imports, while steel imports were targeted only in 5 percent of the cases. Why did China's petrochemical and steel industries behave so differently in seeking trade protection? The answers put forward by researchers Regina Abrami (Harvard Business School) and Yu Zheng (University of Connecticut) point toward the structural nature of the industries themselves, and against arguments that antidumping actions in China have been driven by retaliation or national industrial strategy alone. Key concepts include: Existing patterns of antidumping investigations in China mainly reflect how firms may respond to economic challenges in the context of structural constraints. Rather than serving as a defense against global competition, strong local interests in China seem to be facilitating it. They do so by getting in the way of the kinds of industrial consolidations that seem necessary to wage successful battles through antidumping mechanisms. The research does not dismiss a role for economic or political interests as motivating factors, but does suggest that in their own right they cannot explain fully the patterns that exist. The research demonstrates that domestic business interest groups can influence state policy outcomes in China; that their ability to do so is closely related to resolution of collective action problems; and that Chinese industrial strategy is a far less coordinated political outcome than the increasingly popular idea of ""China Inc."" suggests.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Chemical
373,Extending Producer Responsibility: An Evaluation Framework for Product Take-Back Policies,/item/extending-producer-responsibility-an-evaluation-framework-for-product-take-back-policies,06 Nov 2008,"Managing products at the end of life (EOL) is of growing concern for durable goods manufacturers. While some manufacturers engage in voluntary ""take back"" of EOL products for a variety of competitive reasons, the past 10 years have seen the rapid proliferation of government regulations and policies requiring manufacturers to collect and recycle their products, or pay others to do so on their behalf. Toffel, Stein, and Lee develop a framework for evaluating the extent to which these product take-back regulations offer the potential to reduce the environmental impacts of these products in an effective and cost-efficient manner, while also providing adequate occupational health and safety protection. The evaluation framework is illustrated with examples drawn from take-back regulations in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Key concepts include: The authors identify key policy levers that promote cost efficiency while reducing risks to the environment, public health, and the workers involved in recovery operations. Key policy decisions include setting the scope of manufacturer responsibilities, the stringency of recovery and recycling targets, design-for-environment requirements and substance bans, restrictions on when customer fees can be imposed, and limitations on the industrial organization of the recycling market.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Chemical

Users of MapEcos can easily find detailed information on the environmental performance of facilities across the United States.

426,From Green Users to Green Voters,/item/from-green-users-to-green-voters,22 Aug 2013,"Does the diffusion of technology affect voting patterns? Technology is usually not aligned with a specific ideology or political party. Indeed, to the extent that technology raises living standards, all parties tend to favor technology diffusion. However, in some cases, voters may associate a political party with a specific technology. Green parties, for example, advocate for the diffusion of green energy technologies and pursue policies that foster the diffusion of green energies. This paper finds a significant effect of photovoltaic (PV) adoption on the increase in the share of votes for Germany's Green Party. In particular, the increase in the diffusion rate of PV systems between 1998 and 2009 led to an increase in the fraction of green votes of 1 percent, which represents 25 percent of the actual increase in the voting rate experienced by the Green Party between 1998 and 2009. Key concepts include: This study uncovered the impact that the diffusion of PV systems has on the votes obtained by Germany's Green Party. Individuals that use green technologies are more likely to become Green Party voters. Approximately a quarter of the increase in the share of votes experienced by the Green Party between 1998 and 2009 is driven by the diffusion of PV systems. In contrast, there were no such effects from the diffusion of industrial PV systems and eolic systems. This contrast confirms the importance of voters' direct involvement with the adoption and/or operation of the technology for this to affect their voting patterns.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas

432,“Power from Sunshine”: A Business History of Solar Energy,/item/power-from-sunshine-a-business-history-of-solar-energy,14 Jun 2012,"In each generation, the concept of getting ""power from sunshine"" has attracted entrepreneurial visionaries who encountered a perennial problem: Solar energy was expensive compared to conventional fuels that were not priced to incorporate wider environmental costs. This paper by Geoffrey Jones and Loubna Bouamane provides a business history of solar energy between the nineteenth century and the present day. Its covers early attempts to develop solar energy, the use of passive solar in architecture before World War II, the subsequent growth of the modern photovoltaic (PV) industry, and alternative non-PV technologies such as parabolic collectors. As the authors argue, building viable business models proved crucially dependent on two factors: the prices of alternative conventional fuels and public policy. Key concepts include: The potential of solar power has attracted entrepreneurs for well over a century, but they have all struggled to build commercial businesses. The invention of PV cells in the 1950s, the ""space age electronic marvel,"" transformed the potential of solar energy, but also vastly raised the financing stakes as the new technology was complicated and capital-expensive. Niche markets were found, especially among end-users such as satellites, pocket calculators and roof tops, but the widespread use of solar to generate electricity in large grid systems required government subsidies and other support, especially because the environmental costs of fossil fuels were not included in pricing. Subsidies and feed-in tariffs drove the growth of the solar industry over the last decade, especially in Europe and China, but they also distorted incentives and sometimes encouraged rent-seeking. Regular and unpredictable shifts in government policies, influenced by lobbying and shifts in the price of conventional energy sources, were especially damaging to renewable energy, with shifting Federal and state policies in the United States providing a prime example.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas

In addition, most of these companies operate in multiple host countries. What determines their disclosure of business activities and hence transparency? Paul Healy, Venkat Kuppuswamy, and George Serafeim examine three forms of disclosure costs that oil and gas managers could potentially consider. Both the US government and the European Union are currently considering laws that would require oil and gas companies to disclose information about operations in host countries. Key concepts include: Competitive risks are an important factor underlying differences in oil and gas firms' disclosure ratings across the host countries in which they operate. Requiring disclosure of payments to foreign governments is unlikely to increase proprietary costs for oil and gas companies. Mandating disclosures about the performance of oil and gas companies in host countries, however, is likely to increase proprietary costs, particularly risk of expropriations and costs related to product market competition. Companies that are coming from more corrupt home countries tend to be less transparent about their payments to host country governments.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas

Geography has mattered to some extent, also: Both in the United States and Denmark, the existence of rural areas not supplied by electricity provided the initial stimulus to entrepreneurs and innovators. Building firm-level capabilities has been essential in an industry which has been both technically difficult and vulnerable to policy shifts. Key concepts include: Firms from Denmark have been unusually prominent throughout the history of the wind energy business. The basis of the competitive Danish industry was laid without support or even encouragement from its government. US-based firms have also been regularly found among the leading wind energy companies. But their relative importance varied considerably over time, has rarely reflected the overall importance of the U.S. market, and has involved a changing cast of actual firms. German and Spanish, and more recently Indian and Chinese firms, have emerged to become amongst the largest turbine manufacturers in the industry. The most striking change over the last decade has been in the competitive landscape. Engineering powerhouses, such as GE and Siemens, and wholly or partly state-owned Chinese firms with low-cost bases, are now prominent actors in this industry.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas

Key concepts include: The US response to events in the Middle East and North Africa needs to be guided by three key tenets of effective diplomacy: considering our enemies tomorrow, not just our friends today; identifying what makes these situations different from other, similar situations; and being steered by values that can be clearly and consistently articulated. Although they bring uncertainty and higher oil prices in the short term, these revolutions offer the possibility of enhanced representation that will bring the people in these nations more stability, public goods, and a better and more competitive business environment. In autocratic states, protestors always face the threat of violent retribution. Social media networks helped to allay fears by showing people beforehand that the protests would be huge, thus providing some reassurance that it would be difficult for the regimes to retaliate.

Clean-tech start-ups are often stymied by a ""valley of death""—that precarious stage between researching and developing a product and going to market.

The problem: Energy is a commodity product that can't be differentiated, the sector already exists, and the change needs to happen at enormous scale.

HBS professor Richard Vietor reflects on wind energy and innovations in the renewable energy industry. Key concepts include: The Cape Wind project has sparked controversy in the eastern United States related to regulatory, political, environmental, and social concerns. Wind power is important for the near term, but in the longer term solar and nuclear power may gain ground. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries in its approach to renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, President Obama's stimulus package provides significant incentives and subsidies for green energy projects.

In Mexico, the expropriation is viewed as a patriotic triumph, in which the federal government seized control of the country's most valuable natural resource. In the U.S., the temperate reaction of the Roosevelt Administration is seen as the decisive break with Washington's imperial relationship towards Latin America. Washington ""curbed its finance capital,"" it is said, and downgraded the protection of American overseas private investments. In this paper, HBS professor Noel Maurer explains how the actual historical record diverges substantially from the accepted view. Key concepts include: The oil companies developed political strategies that maneuvered the very reluctant Roosevelt Administration into defending their interests. A detailed understanding of the key players in the executive branch was fundamental to these strategies. The U.S. government succeeded using sanctions and the threat of sanctions to force Mexico to compensate—in fact, overcompensate—American companies. The Mexican oil industry was in decline by the 1930s for geological (not political) reasons. As a result, the American oil companies with interests in Mexico were in financial distress during the same period. The oil companies deliberately provoked the expropriation, because they could not afford to give in to union demands to control all hiring and firing. The expropriation did not increase the Mexican government's petroleum revenues or the wages paid to Mexican oil workers. The key difference between the environment of the 1930s and today is that in the 1930s, domestic courts still refused to use their authority against foreign governments. Today, that is no longer the case.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas
446,Accelerating Innovation In Energy: Insights from Multiple Sectors,/item/accelerating-innovation-in-energy-insights-from-multiple-sectors,24 Feb 2010,"How should the energy sector best respond to the threat of climate change? In this introductory chapter to a forthcoming book, Harvard Business School's Rebecca M. Henderson and Richard G. Newell of Duke University frame the discussion by highlighting the volume's contributions concerning four particularly innovative sectors of the U.S. economy: agriculture, chemicals, life sciences, and information technology. These four sectors have been extraordinarily important in driving recent economic growth. Henderson and Newell describe why accelerating innovation in energy could play an important role in shaping an effective response to climate change. Key concepts include: An effective innovation system has three key elements: accelerating demand for new technology; institutions that support abundant generation and dissemination of fundamental scientific and technical knowledge; and a vibrant, competitive private sector. Public policy has played a role in building and/or sustaining all three elements. If the goal of federal policy is to encourage effective technological solutions to mitigate climate change, then a short-term commitment is unlikely to meet expectations, even if the commitment is extraordinarily intense, such as was seen with the Department of Defense's Manhattan Project. If federal agencies increase investment in energy innovation at the same time that vigorous efforts are made to enhance the demand for carbon-free technology, it is likely that technological innovation could play a decisive role in mitigating some of the key economic and social risks arising from climate change.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas

Key concepts include: The Western notion that Russia uses energy as a weapon is a media oversimplification of very complicated politics. Gazprom is the country's single most important company and biggest taxpayer. Because natural gas is much cleaner than oil or coal, Europe will likely become even more dependent on Russian gas.

Cognitive, organizational, and political barriers exist that prevent us from addressing energy problems despite clearly identified courses of action. The creation and implementation of wise policy recommendations requires us to anticipate resistance to change and develop strategies that can overcome these barriers. Enacting wise legislation to act in time to solve energy problems requires surmounting cognitive, organizational, and political barriers to change. Key concepts include: The new U.S. presidential administration should identify energy policies that make wise tradeoffs across issues. The administration should communicate that decisions will be made to maximize benefits to society rather than to special-interest groups. The administration should seek energy policies that make sense even if climate change is less of a problem than best current estimates suggest. The administration should identify a series of small changes (nudges) that significantly influence the behaviors of individuals and organizations in a positive direction without infringing on personal liberties. When discounting of the future creates an insurmountable barrier to the implementation of wise policies, consider implementation on a mild delay.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas
452,Economics of the Ethanol Business,/item/economics-of-the-ethanol-business,03 Nov 2008,"What happens when a group of Missouri corn farmers gets into the energy business? What appears to be a very lucrative decision quickly turns out to be much more risky. Professor Forest Reinhardt leads a case discussion on what the protagonists should do next. From HBS Alumni Bulletin. Key concepts include: The case examines the complex political and economic underpinnings of the ethanol industry. By investing in corn-based ethanol, farmers reduce their exposure to corn prices, but at the expense of exposure to the oil market. The case promotes greater understanding of the way materials and energy flow in the modern U.S. agricultural system.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas
453,The Value of Environmental Activists,/item/the-value-of-environmental-activists,08 Sep 2008,"With decidedly non-profit goals leading them on, how do environmental protection groups such as Greenpeace and World Wildlife Fund create value? Can it be measured? A Q&A with Harvard Business School professor Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and case writer Jordan Mitchell. Key concepts include: The challenge for a business student is how to put a quantifiable measure on whether Greenpeace and WWF are successful in reaching goals. WWF and Greenpeace create value by increasing the world's willingness-to-pay on environmental issues. Most scientists agree that the earth is deteriorating at a faster rate than during the 1960s and 1970s, but it would be worse off had it not been for the tireless campaigning of environmental NGOs.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas
454,Innovation Corrupted: How Managers Can Avoid Another Enron,/item/innovation-corrupted-how-managers-can-avoid-another-enron,07 Jul 2008,"The train wreck that was Enron provides key insights for improving corporate governance and financial incentives as well as organizational processes that strengthen ethical discipline, says HBS professor emeritus Malcolm S. Salter. His new book, Innovation Corrupted: The Origins and Legacy of Enron's Collapse, is a deep reflection on the present and future of business. Key concepts include: Enron's stated purpose was too general to permit disciplined and responsible decision-making in the face of difficulty. The lessons of Enron relate to strengthening board oversight, avoiding perverse financial incentives for executives, and instilling ethical discipline throughout business organizations. Directors of public companies can adapt key aspects of the private-equity governance model to ensure that they fulfill their oversight responsibilities. Incentive systems should reward accomplishments other than economic performance, and penalize failures. Companies can take steps to help senior executives avoid the two sources of leadership failure at Enron: personal opportunism and flights to utopianism.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas
455,A Resource Belief-Curse: Oil and Individualism,/item/a-resource-belief-curse-oil-and-individualism,09 Jan 2008,"Capitalism is not as widespread as economists would hope. Data from surveys of public opinion, as well as on the distribution of political parties, confirm the idea that capitalism doesn't flow to poor countries. In some countries, anti-market sentiment has increased in recent years, a period where the price of oil and other primary commodities have soared. This combination of anti-market sentiment and high oil prices has led to renegotiations of oil contracts and even nationalizations in some countries such as Bolivia and Venezuela. It is tempting for economists trained in the theory of political capture to argue that this is just another instance where special interests exploit the circumstances to make an extra dollar. Given that these nationalizations are often popular with the majority of voters, however, the researchers resist this temptation and ask if there are explanations where a positive correlation emerges between voter anti-market sentiment and dependence on oil. Key concepts include: Antipathy toward markets has become particularly acute in Latin America. In Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Argentina, policymakers have focused their anti-market energies and attention on natural resource companies, in several cases even renegotiating their contracts. A connection between dependence on oil and receptivity to populist rhetoric is both natural in economic models and has some support in the data.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas

How should firms respond? A case study exploring how financial service giant UBS thinks through the issues has students coming down on different sides. Key concepts include: Firms are increasingly called upon to respond to public concerns and actions by competitors on the issue of climate change. 'Green' responses that are simple profit maximization won't impress activist organizations looking to reward exemplars. Companies who take leadership roles in the environmental arena also open themselves up as critical targets should something go wrong. In responding to requests from organizations, general managers should think strategically about how, if they get the decision right, the company can serve society while also improving the bottom line.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas

It communicates with stakeholders, of course, but can also help employees take a step back and analyze their firm as outsiders do. Harvard Business School's Gregory S. Miller, Vincent Dessain, and Daniela Beyersdorfer explain where IR is going, with energy giants BP and Total leading the way. Key concepts include: Good news for stockholders can be bad news for other stakeholders. IR should be consistent and proactive on all fronts. Investors increasingly care about geopolitics, the environment, and social responsibility; financial communication will need to factor this in. Develop IR in a way consistent with your firm's unique operating position. Outside information is important, but the extent to which it should influence a firm's decision-making is an open question.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas

460,Risky Business? Protecting Foreign Investments,/item/risky-business-protecting-foreign-investments,05 Mar 2007,"After a string of forced nationalizations of private enterprises in the 1960s and 1970s, the pendulum swung back and companies were again encouraged by host countries to build and run major infrastructure projects such as power and water. But a set of new property protections has done little to manage the risk in many of these politically unstable environments. Professor Louis T. Wells, coauthor of a new book on making foreign investment safe, discusses the current landscape. Key concepts include: Although property rights protections for investors in developing nations have improved since 1980, the new instruments are failing to satisfy the interests of either host countries or their business partners. Protections can be improved by developing a real consensus on the part of investors' home countries, host countries, and investors themselves. Business managers must take a significant role in pushing for a multilateral agreement on foreign direct investment, or at least become active in promoting lesser changes that will lead to more balance and security in the current system. Otherwise businesses will lose profitable opportunities and find themselves in the middle of disputes that hurt their future prospects. And poor countries will fail to benefit from what investors can bring them. Absent strong protections, managers must ask themselves a series of questions before investing in developing countries, such as: Is my investment project politically sensitive? If so, will the country continue to need my participation in the project?Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas
461,"Manly Men, Oil Platforms, and Breaking Stereotypes",/item/manly-men-oil-platforms-and-breaking-stereotypes,27 Nov 2006,"Men who work in dangerous places often act invulnerable to prove their merit as workers and as men—objectives that can lead to decreased safety and efficiency. Professor Robin Ely and her team helicoptered to offshore oil platforms in order to understand ""manly men"" and how working environments can be changed to alter men's enactments of manhood. Key concepts include: Men's masculine identity (like women's feminine identity) is a profoundly social and cultural phenomenon. In dangerous, male-dominated work settings, men's tendency to gain respect by demonstrating and defending their masculinity is costly. Efforts to appear invulnerable block precisely the kinds of actions that encourage safety and effectiveness. Offshore oil platforms, although male dominated, are also improving safety dramatically. Rather than seeking to prove how tough, proficient, and cool-headed they are, platform workers purposefully make themselves vulnerable in order to perform their jobs more safely and effectively.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electric Power & Natural Gas

More than 70 percent of small businesses seek loans in amounts under $250,000 and more than 60 percent want loans under $100,000.

The authors then describe the current regulatory environment with its large number of agencies, each with overlapping authority and mandates, and provide a set of recommendations for regulatory activity that will protect borrowers and investors in this space.

628,Adding Value Through Venture Capital in Latin America and the Caribbean,/item/adding-value-through-venture-capital-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean,03 Nov 2014,"The process of value creation starts with the choice of a promising company, extends through the structure of the investment and into the deal management process, and ends as the venture capitalist positions the company for an exit to a situation where it can continue to grow. In all regions, value creation plays an important role in every venture capital investment. Given the relative youth of the industry in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the issue of value addition is particularly critical. In this paper the authors draw on scholarship, industry statistics, and interviews with six LAC fund managers. They also place the material in the context of their combined 56 years of experience studying the VC industry in order to describe the challenges facing fund managers in value creation. The paper concludes with nine best practices that should be especially helpful in LAC as these economies develop. Key concepts include: There are nine best practices for creating value in portfolio companies. Some of them apply to the internal operations of the VC firm while others address methods through which the fund managers interact with the portfolio companies. An unwillingness to risk failure restrains LAC's innovative and entrepreneurial culture. Entrepreneurs in the LAC region are less familiar with best practices in business, such as reaching beyond family and friends for investors in their companies, and most are new to the expectations of active, equity-owning investors. Situations vary greatly between countries. What works in one LAC country may not succeed in another, forcing fund managers to be particularly flexible and creative to add value in their portfolio companies.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
629,"Housing Collateral, Credit Constraints, and Entrepreneurship-Evidence from a Mortgage Reform",/item/housing-collateral-credit-constraints-and-entrepreneurship-evidence-from-a-mortgage-reform,30 Oct 2014,"One of the strongest findings in studies of entrepreneurship is the clear positive correlation between personal wealth and the propensity to engage in entrepreneurship. One study, for example, has shown that entrepreneurs comprise just under 9 percent of households in the United States, but hold about 40 percent of total net worth. The most common explanation for this correlation is that credit constraints pose an important barrier to entry for less wealthy individuals. However, others have questioned the degree to which financing constraints are barriers to entrepreneurship, particularly in advanced economies where firms have adequate access to capital. In this paper, the authors consider a unique mortgage reform in Denmark to study how increasing access to credit through the unlocking of housing collateral for personal loans had an impact on entrepreneurship. Findings show that the reform affected the ability to draw on debt backed by home equity. However, despite the positive and statistically significant effect of relaxing credit constraints on entrepreneurship, the magnitudes are small. Furthermore, an important reason for the small magnitude was that the marginal business founded by those who benefited from the reform was of lower quality, where the new entrants failed within two years of entry. Overall, the results paint a more nuanced picture of the extent to which financing constraints are important in settings with well-developed credit markets, and the role that home equity can play in alleviating these. Key concepts include: Findings address the longstanding question of the importance of credit constraints for entrepreneurship. Housing collateral shifts the bank's adjudication decision from a specific project to the creditworthiness of the borrower. On the one hand, good entrepreneurial projects may be able to be started or sustained. On the other hand, though, optimistic entrepreneurs may start lower quality businesses because they do not face the same discipline from the bank.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

632,The Federal Reserve’s Abandonment of Its 1923 Principles,/item/the-federal-reserves-abandonment-of-its-1923-principles,08 Oct 2014,"One of the most dramatic reversals in Federal Reserve policymaking has been the targeting of monetary policy towards financial stability. In 1923, for example, the Federal Reserve's Annual Report officially announced that the goal of monetary policy was the avoidance of speculative lending, which was thought to lead to inflation and crisis. By contrast, in 2002 there was broad agreement at the Fed with economist Ben Bernanke's view that monetary policy should be aimed exclusively at macroeconomic goals while financial stability should be ensured by regulatory means instead. In this paper the author explains when this reversal occurred and he sheds some light on why it did. He shows that two principles in 1923—the discouraging of speculative lending by commercial banks, and the desire to meet the credit needs of business—remained important in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations until the mid-1960's. After this, the FOMC spent less time discussing the composition of bank loans. Overall, as the author argues, an unwillingness to devote monetary policy to financial stability may well make financial crises more likely. This paper may thus contribute to the understanding of the ultimate sources of the financial crisis of 2007. Key concepts include: This paper explores the persistence and some of the consequences of the eventual abandonment by the FOMC of principles embedded in the Federal Reserve's Tenth Annual Report of 1923. As the Fed directs monetary policy towards financial stability, the history of how it abandoned this earlier goal contains lessons for the future. Understanding the abandonment of the Fed's 1923 principles also sheds light on the relevance of various views about what determines Fed policy.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
633,Bitcoin,/item/bitcoin,02 Oct 2014,"Bitcoin is an online communication protocol that facilitates virtual currency including electronic payments. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has served approximately 41.8 million transactions between 62.8 million accounts, and the total market value of all bitcoins in circulation exceeds $8 billion. This article, forthcoming in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, presents the platform's design principles and properties for a non-technical audience; reviews its past, present, and future uses; and points out risks and regulatory issues as Bitcoin interacts with the conventional financial system and the real economy. Key features of Bitcoin's design are irreversible transactions, a prescribed path of money creation, and a public transaction history. Collectively, these yield a system that is understood to be more flexible, more private, and less amenable to regulatory oversight than other forms of payment--though as discussed in this paper, all these benefits face important limits. Yet the authors argue that the decentralization initially touted by Bitcoin has not fully come to fruition. Indeed there seem to be significant forces pushing towards concentration despite Bitcoin's design, calling into question the benefits that Bitcoin can offer compared to existing payment mechanisms and other stores of value. Key concepts include: The key innovation in Bitcoin is its decentralized core technologies. In particular, Bitcoin relies on network consensus rather than central authorities both for verifying transactions and for minting new currency. While it originally appeared that Bitcoin's decentralization made it unregulable, there now seems to be ample possibility of regulatory oversight, as well as circumstances in which such intervention could be useful. Bitcoin receives regulatory scrutiny for three classes of criminal concerns: Bitcoin-specific crime, money laundering, and Bitcoin-facilitated crime. The Bitcoin platform faces systemic operational risks through potential vulnerabilities in the protocol design or breakthroughs in cryptanalysis.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Not only do they employ half of the nation's private sector workforce--about 120 million people--but also since 1995 they have created approximately two‐thirds of the net new jobs in the country. Yet in recent years, small businesses have been slow to recover from the recession and credit crisis that hit them especially hard. This lag has prompted the question, ""Is there a credit gap in small business lending?"" In this paper the authors compile and analyze the current state of access to bank capital for small business from the best available sources. The authors explore both the cyclical impact of the recession on small business and access to credit, and several structural issues that impede the full recovery of bank credit markets for smaller loans. They argue that the online banking market is likely to continue to grow, disrupting traditional ways of lending to small businesses. This will create both opportunities and risks for policymakers and regulators. Key concepts include: Small businesses create two out of every three net new jobs, but there remains a significant jobs gap. Structural issues make it more difficult for community banks to fill market gaps in small-business lending. New entrants are innovating and using technology in ways that improve access, time needed for delivery of capital, and the overall borrower experience. The policy challenge is to ensure that these new marketplaces have sufficient oversight to prevent abuse, but not too much oversight that the innovation is dampened or delayed.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

640,Banks as Patient Fixed-Income Investors,/item/banks-as-patient-fixed-income-investors,22 Jul 2014,"What is the business of banking? Do banks primarily create value on the liability side of the balance sheet as suggested in theories of banking emphasizing liquidity creation? Does the essence of banking reside on the asset side, as in theories emphasizing banks' ability to monitor borrowers? Or does the special nature of banks derive from some synergy between their assets and liabilities? This paper argues that the specialness of traditional banks comes from combining stable money creation on the liability side with assets that have relatively safe long-run cash flows but possibly volatile market values and limited liquidity. To make this business model work, banks rely on deposit insurance, and bear the associated costs of capital regulation. Some preliminary evidence supports the authors' argument. For traditional banks there is a critical synergy between the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet. Key concepts include: One central role of intermediaries—and of banks in particular—is to act as a bridge between households who want to put their money in a safe place they do not need to watch, and securities markets where even assets with relatively low fundamental risk can have volatile market prices.

644,The Contaminating Effects of Building Instrumental Ties: How Networking Can Make Us Feel Dirty,/item/the-contaminating-effects-of-building-instrumental-ties-how-networking-can-make-us-feel-dirty,13 May 2014,"Network ties are essential to advancement in organizations: they provide access to opportunities, political insight, and technical knowledge. Yet networking with the goal of advancement often leaves individuals feeling somehow bad about themselves—even dirty. The authors use field and laboratory data to examine how goal-oriented or instrumental networking influences individual emotions, attitudes, and outcomes, including consequences for an individual's morality. The authors argue that networking for professional goals can impinge on an individual's moral purity—a psychological state that results from a person's view of the self as clean from a moral standpoint and through which a person feels virtuous—and thus make him or her feel dirty. There are three main insights: First, the authors show the importance of a clear conceptual distinction between instrumental networking driven by individual agency versus spontaneous networking reflecting the constraints and opportunities of the social context. Second, the research establishes the relevance of moral psychology for network theory. Third, because people in powerful positions do not experience the morally contaminating effects of instrumental networking, power emerges from this research as yielding unequal access to networking opportunities, thus reinforcing and perpetuating inequality in performance. Key concepts include: Professional-instrumental networking is the purposeful creation of social ties in support of task and professional goals. The content and approach of networking each influence the psychological experience of those engaging in it, including a person's feelings of moral purity. The amount of power people have when they engage in instrumental networking for professional goals influences how dirty such networking can make them feel. Organizations need to create opportunities for emergent forms of networking, because people who need instrumental networking the most are the least likely to do it.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

646,Corporate Financial Policies in Misvalued Credit Markets,/item/corporate-financial-policies-in-misvalued-credit-markets,23 Apr 2014,"The potential for overvaluation to impact firm decision-making is a potent idea with a long history in economic scholarship from foundational works to modern day texts. However, virtually all work on this idea has considered the potential for equity overvaluation to have an impact. The impact of bond market overvaluation on firm policies has thus far received little attention. This limited focus on potential debt market overvaluation is surprising given its size and importance to the economy: the US corporate bond market comprised $7.7 trillion in assets in 2011. The authors begin to fill the gap in scholarship by introducing the idea that mistakes made by the rating agencies should be correlated with bond pricing mistakes. They then examine the correlation in bond rating mistakes with the issuance decisions of firms as well as their cash holding, investment, and acquisition decisions. Findings include evidence that firms take advantage of inaccuracies by issuing more debt and increasing leverage. The result goes beyond a wealth transfer and has real investment implications: approximately 75 percent of the debt issuance funds increased capital expenditures and cash acquisitions. Key concepts include: Two of the most important questions in financial economics are: Why do firms choose to issue debt or equity? What causes firms to invest? This study shows that firms take advantage of inaccuracies by issuing more debt and increasing leverage. The evidence is suggestive of managers' awareness of the mistakes in real time and an active exploitation of them. Misvaluation affects financially constrained firms the most, supporting the theoretical prediction that debt overvaluation loosens financial constraints.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

649,The Use of Broker Votes to Reward Brokerage Firms’ and Their Analysts’ Research Activities,/item/the-use-of-broker-votes-to-reward-brokerage-firms-and-their-analysts-research-activities,19 Mar 2014,"Broker votes are one of the most pervasive yet least understood reporting practices on Wall Street. The votes are essentially ratings of the value of brokers' investment research services. These ratings are produced by institutional investors (the ""buy side"") and solicited by broker dealers (the ""sell side""). Little research to date, however, has examined the determinants of broker votes, their consequences, and their economic function. In this paper the authors use data gathered from a mid-sized investment bank for the years 2004 to 2007 in order to study how broker votes are related to institutional investors' commission payments and analysts' client services and compensation. Results overall suggest that broker votes help to facilitate implicit contractual relationships between sell-side brokers, their affiliated analysts, and their buy-side clients. Broker votes are neither mere popularity contests nor a simple reflection of trading in analysts' covered stocks. Instead, they appear to be a key component of the investment research industry's contracting technology, acting as the nexus for a set of relationships between sell-side brokers, their affiliated analysts, and their buy-side clients. The findings thus deepen our understanding of how information is exchanged on Wall Street and help to explain why the practice of collecting and aggregating client votes—a costly internal reporting procedure—has stood the test of time and has been replicated across countless sell-side research departments. Key concepts include: Broker votes facilitate a set of implicit contractual relationships between sell-side brokers, their affiliated analysts, and their buy-side clients. These voluntary contracting arrangements help to resolve inter- and intra-firm coordination problems. Broker votes may represent real efforts by buy-side clients to reward analysts for providing information that is difficult to reward through contemporaneous trading in analysts' covered stocks. Broker votes influence resource allocation within brokerage divisions, aligning analysts' incentives with their clients' objectives and hence the brokerage firm.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

651,Integrated Reporting and Investor Clientele,/item/integrated-reporting-and-investor-clientele,24 Feb 2014,"As a relatively new phenomenon in the world of corporate reporting, integrated reporting (IR) has gained traction across both the corporate and investor community in the last 10 years. A recent pilot program of the International Integrated Reporting Council, for example, included more than 100 large multinational companies supported by an investor network with more than 40 members. Although IR has the potential to fundamentally change corporate reporting, we still know relatively little about its causes and consequences. Proponents of IR argue that the attraction of long-term investors is a benefit of adopting IR. While anecdotal evidence has suggested the presence of a link, no empirical evidence to date has been provided to establish such a relation. In this paper, the author examines how the practice of IR affects the investor base of the firm. Specifically, analyzing data on more than 1,000 firms between 2002 and 2010, he finds that firms practicing IR have a more long-term investor base and fewer transient investors. In addition, evidence supports a causal mechanism from IR to the investor base of a firm. Investor activism on sustainability issues is shown to be effective in improving IR, but such investor-induced changes in IR do not affect the composition of the investor base. Overall, the paper contributes to emerging scholarship that seeks to understand the causes and consequences of sustainability and integrated reporting. It also contributes to studies examining how companies cater to different types of investors. Key concepts include: Integrated Reporting (IR) is a reporting innovation that serves as an important determinant of the composition of a firm's investor base. Firms that practice IR tend to have fewer transient investors and more dedicated investors who are oriented to the long term. IR is a rare experiment in fundamentally changing corporate reporting. More research is needed on what are the motivations of different firms that practice IR, as well as research on whether and how IR instills 'integrated thinking' inside the firm.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

656,Standard-Essential Patents,/item/standard-essential-patents,25 Nov 2013,"Standards play a key role in many industries, including those critical for future growth. Intellectual property (IP) owners vie to have their technologies incorporated into standards, so as to collect royalty revenues (if their patents dominate some of the functionalities embodied in the standard) or just to develop a competitive edge through their familiarity with the technology. However, it is hard to know in advance whether patents are complements or substitutes, i.e., how essential they are. Thus a major policy issue in standard setting is that patents that seem relatively unimportant may, by being included into the standard, become standard-essential patents (SEPs). In an attempt to curb the monopoly power that the standard creates, most standard-setting organizations (SSOs) require the owners of patents covered by the standard to grant licenses on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Needless to say, such loose price commitments can lead to intense litigation activity. This paper constitutes a first pass at a formal analysis of standard-essential patents. It builds a framework in which essentiality and regulation functions can be analyzed, provides a precise identification of the inefficiencies attached to the lack of price commitment, and suggests a policy reform that restores the ex-ante competition called for in the literature and the policy debate. Key concepts include: Standards transform inessential patents into standard-essential ones. Price discussions within the standard setting process run the risk of expropriation of IP holders, as even balanced SSOs will ""blackmail"" IP owners to accept low prices in exchange for their functionalities' being selected into the standard. The ability to engage in forum shopping enables IP owners to shun SSOs that force them to charge competitive prices. This suggests imposing mandatory structured price commitments on SSOs.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
657,What Shapes the Gatekeepers? Evidence from Global Supply Chain Auditors,/item/what-shapes-the-gatekeepers-evidence-from-global-supply-chain-auditors,14 Nov 2013,"Private gatekeepers, from credit rating agencies to supply-chain auditors, are supposed to provide unbiased, objective assessments of companies' internal operations, and such private assessments play a central role in contemporary regulatory regimes. While the impartiality of gatekeeping organizations has come into question over the past decade, little is known about what drives the decisions of the individual accountants, auditors, analysts, and attorneys who work at these organizations. Using data from a private, third-party social auditing firm that assesses global supply chain factories' adherence to corporate codes of conduct governing workplace conditions, this study reveals that external auditors' findings are shaped by a combination of economic incentives and social factors. The study highlights opportunities to design and staff audits to maximize their impartiality and credibility. Key concepts include: Gatekeepers, such as accountants, attorneys, auditors, and analysts, typically have substantial professional discretion to make vital gatekeeping decisions on the ground. In the supply-chain auditing context, gatekeepers are influenced by conflicts of interest and by social factors, including ongoing relationships with clients, on-the-job experience, professional training, and gender diversity. Companies using auditors and other gatekeepers should consider not only which organization to hire, but also the characteristics of the staff deployed on the gatekeeping teams. Auditing teams can benefit from gender diversity, professional training, and experience, although the marginal benefits of the latter attenuate over time. Regulatory systems reliant on private gatekeepers should be designed to mitigate the effects of conflict of interest and leverage social factors of team compositions to enhance the reliability and integrity of gatekeeping decisions.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
658,"Imperfect Information, Patent Publication, and the Market for Ideas",/item/imperfect-information-patent-publication-and-the-market-for-ideas,04 Oct 2013,"The market for ideas improves the innovation process by promoting division of labor between upstream inventors and downstream developers. Frictions such as asymmetric information and search costs may hinder the smooth functioning of the market and delay, or even block, mutually profitable transactions between buyers and sellers. In this paper, the authors study the effects of an important disclosure mechanism, the publication of patent applications, on mitigating these frictions and, thus, facilitating transactions in the market for ideas. In particular, they employ an important policy change in the American Inventors Protection Act (AIPA), which required that U.S. patent applications filed beginning on November 29, 2000 be published 18 months after the application date. Findings show that post-AIPA patents, on average, are licensed 8.5 months earlier than pre-AIPA inventions. This shortening of the licensing lag is economically significant, given the 20-year duration of U.S. patents, and can translate to millions of dollars in profits and licensing revenues. Key concepts include: Disclosure through patent publication facilitates transactions in the market for ideas, potentially through reducing frictions such as information asymmetries, search costs, and costs of evaluating competing ideas. For inventors that choose to license, 18-month publication accelerates licensing by 8.5 months on average.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

660,Playing Favorites: How Firms Prevent the Revelation of Bad News,/item/playing-favorites-how-firms-prevent-the-revelation-of-bad-news,26 Sep 2013,"Given the current regulatory environment in the United States (and increasingly globally) of level playing-field information laws, firms can only communicate information in public exchanges. However, even in these highly regulated venues, there are subtle choices that firms make that reveal differential amounts of information to the market. In this paper the authors explore a subtle but economically important way in which firms shape their information environments, namely through their specific organization and choreographing of earnings conference calls. The analysis rests on a simple premise: firms understand they have an information advantage and the ability to be strategic in its release. The key finding is that firms that manipulate their conference calls by calling on those analysts with the most optimistic views on the firm appear to be hiding bad news, which ultimately leaks out in the future. Specifically, the authors show that ""casting"" firms experience higher contemporaneous returns on the (manipulated) call in question, but negative returns in the future. These negative future returns are concentrated around future calls where they stop this casting behavior, and hence allow negative information to be revealed to the market. Key concepts include: The paper shows new evidence on a channel through which firms influence information disclosure even in level-playing-field information environments. The pattern of firms appearing to choreograph information exchanges directly prior to the revelation of negative news is systematic across the universe of firms.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
661,The Impact of Patent Wars on Firm Strategy: Evidence from the Global Smartphone Market,/item/the-impact-of-patent-wars-on-firm-strategy-evidence-from-the-global-smartphone-market,27 Aug 2013,"Patents and patent enforcement strategies have become an essential part of firms' competitive strategies: They are used as isolating mechanisms to protect intellectual property or as defense mechanisms to help obtain access to external innovations. Using data from the global smartphone market, the authors of this paper investigate the effect of escalated patent litigations—the so-called patent war—on firm strategy. The smartphone industry is a classic example of a business ecosystem, as participants in this industry are highly interconnected and this interconnectivity means that effects on some ecosystem participants are likely to extend to affect the rest. The authors' findings show that the efficacy of patent enforcement systems across markets plays a significant role in firm strategy during patent wars, and ultimately shapes the global competitive landscape. As the patent war intensifies, smartphone vendors, even those not directly involved in patent litigations, gradually shift their business foci to markets with weaker intellectual property (IP) rights protection. This shift, however, is attenuated for vendors with stronger technological capabilities and is more pronounced for vendors whose home markets have weak IP systems. Together, these changes shape the competitive landscape for platform competition. Key concepts include: This study enhances our understanding of patents, patent enforcement strategies, and the dynamics of patent wars in platform competition. Patent strategy and its enforcement are becoming increasingly important for value appropriation by innovators, similar to marketing and pricing. Firms use markets with strong IP protection as a natural battleground for their patent enforcement strategies, which leads to increased litigation risk for other participants in those markets. As the patent war intensifies, smartphone vendors focus their businesses more on markets with weak IP protection than on those with strong IP protection, even when they are not involved in patent litigation themselves. This effect is more pronounced for vendors with weak technological capabilities, and vendors that come from countries with weak IP systems. Consistent with the shift at the vendor level, Android market share grows faster in weak IP countries than in strong IP countries as the patent war intensifies. Interestingly, this result suggests that the patent war intended to hamper the proliferation of Android phones may have merely shifted the sales of Android phones to weak IP countries. Consequently, the Android system has flourished in weak IP countries.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

663,Do Strict Capital Requirements Raise the Cost of Capital? Banking Regulation and the Low Risk Anomaly,/item/do-strict-capital-requirements-raise-the-cost-of-capital-banking-regulation-and-the-low-risk-anomaly,06 Jun 2013,"The instability of banks in the financial crisis of 2008 has stoked the enduring debate about optimal capital requirements. One of the central concerns has long been the possibility that capital requirements affect banks' overall cost of capital, and therefore lending rates and economic activity. In this paper, the authors estimate how leverage affects the risk and cost of bank equity and the overall cost of capital in practice. They are especially motivated by the potential interaction of capital requirements and the ""low risk anomaly"" within the stock market: That is, while stocks have on average earned higher returns than less risky asset classes like corporate bonds, which in turn have earned more than Treasury bonds, it is less appreciated that the basic risk-return relationship within the stock market has historically been flat-if not inverted. Using a large sample of historical US data, the authors find that the low risk anomaly within banks may represent an unrecognized and possibly substantial downside of heightened capital requirements. However, despite the fact that tightened capital requirements may considerably increase the cost of capital and lending rates, with adverse implications for investment and growth, such requirements may well remain desirable when all other private and social benefits and costs are tallied up. Key concepts include: Many economists make the theoretical argument, built on efficient markets, that heightened capital requirements will have a modest effect on the overall cost of capital, because more capital lowers the risk of equity and hence its cost. Capital requirements are likely to lower the risk of equity, but not its cost. The ""low risk anomaly,"" which says that the link between risk and return is weak or inverted and appears in both U.S. and international equity markets, is also apparent within banking stocks. Lower risk banks have the same or higher returns than higher risk banks. Unless long-term and worldwide patterns are reversed, reducing equity beta will not reduce the cost of equity. When all other private and social costs and benefits are totaled up, strict capital requirements may well remain desirable. However, the low volatility anomaly produces an underappreciated and potentially significant cost to consider.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

666,The Auditing Oligopoly and Lobbying on Accounting Standards,/item/the-auditing-oligopoly-and-lobbying-on-accounting-standards,16 Apr 2013,"The US auditing industry has been characterized as an oligopoly, which has successively tightened from eight key players to four over the last 25 years. This tightening is likely to change the incentives of the surviving big auditors, with implications for their role in our market economy. Motivated by the economic and public policy implications of the tightening audit oligopoly, the authors of this paper investigate the changing relation between the big firms and accounting standards. Accounting standards are a key input in the audit process and, through their effects on financial reporting, can impact capital allocation decisions in the economy. Results show that the big auditors are more likely to identify decreased reliability in proposed standards as the auditing oligopoly has tightened: This suggests that big auditors perceive higher litigation and political costs from the increased visibility that accompanies tighter oligopoly. The findings are also consistent with tighter oligopoly decreasing competition among the surviving firms to satisfy client preferences in accounting standards. The findings do not support the concern that tightening oligopoly has rendered the surviving big firms ""too big to fail."" Key concepts include: This research investigates the impact of the tightening audit oligopoly on ""Big Four"" auditors' propensity to discuss decreased ""reliability"" in accounting standards proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ""Reliability"" is a key attribute of accounting. Moreover, reliability is directly relevant to auditors because it entails ""verifiability,"" another key aspect of auditing. As the auditing oligopoly has tightened, big auditors are more prone to eschew the judgment and risks inherent in less reliable accounting standards. Results provide some descriptive evidence on the evolution of ""rules"" over ""principles"" in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The growth of rules-based accounting standards is significant because it can result in a collectivization of auditing and financial reporting risks in ways that can be sub-optimal for capital allocation. Results do not support the notion that the tightening oligopoly has rendered the surviving big audit firms ""too big to fail.""Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
667,Monitoring and the Portability of Soft Information,/item/monitoring-and-the-portability-of-soft-information,02 Apr 2013,"This study examines the ""portability"" of soft information within a decentralized financial institution. Using a unique dataset on loans from a large credit union and employees' notes summarizing their interactions with borrowers, the authors provide new insights on the portability of soft information within organizations, focusing in particular on an internal monitoring system used at this field site which, in effect, acts as a central repository of soft information gathered in the course of interactions between employees and customers. Contrary to the prevailing view that soft information lacks portability, results provide evidence that the ""stock"" of soft information accumulated in this system has persistent effects on the lending decisions of employees. Overall, findings indicate that the centralization of soft information acquired in past borrower-employee interactions can enable organizations to separate this informational asset from individual employees to facilitate future loan decisions. These results suggest that centralized information technology can alleviate the well-documented barriers of transmitting soft information consistent with economic theories on the role of centralization of information as a complement to decentralized decision-making. Key concepts include: Portability of information means the extent to which it can be stored for, communicated to, and used over time and by employees other than those that originally acquired or produced the information. Internal centralized information systems can facilitate the transmission of soft information across employees in different branches. Findings complement the literature on the role of information systems as a means of improving information processing and coordinating decentralized decision-making within financial institutions.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

669,In Strange Company: The Puzzle of Private Investment in State-Controlled Firms,/item/in-strange-company-the-puzzle-of-private-investment-in-state-controlled-firms,27 Feb 2013,"Why do ""mixed corporations"" exist? In which conditions could they become efficient organizational forms? In this paper, the authors argue that the effectiveness of mixed enterprise depends on a hybrid governance structure combining elements of private ownership with public checks-and- balances against uncertain governmental interference. This is a delicate equilibrium to obtain and one not without challenges. Exploring the promise and perils of this approach by looking at the recent experience of a sample of national oil companies (NOCs)-Brazil's Petrobras, Norway's Statoil, and Mexico's Pemex-the authors suggest that from the perspective of a social planner, the coexistence of minority private investors with state actors can generate improvements in operational and financial performance. From the perspective of private shareholders, there are risks that can be outweighed by some of the advantages of state-owned enterprises. Three different factors explain private investor interest. These are 1) the existence of countervailing privileges from partnering with the government, 2) the resort to improved corporate governance and legal constraints that limit the opportunity for political abuse, and 3) ex ante price discounting. Key concepts include: Carefully-designed governance provisions can mitigate, but not eliminate, the degree of political interference to the detriment of minority investors of state-owned enterprises. Neither the very presence of private investors nor the listing of stock on a major stock exchange solves in and by itself the political intervention problem. Because distinct governments may change governance rules at their discretion, it is critically important to have a structure of institutional checks-and-balances in place. The case of Statoil suggests that the presence of a technical, independent regulatory agency, with equal influence on private and state-owned firms, can reduce the level of outright interference by the government. Consequently, the discount applied by private investors may be reduced as well.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Future models of stock market fluctuations should embrace the large fraction of investors whose expectations are extrapolative.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

673,Dollar Funding and the Lending Behavior of Global Banks,/item/dollar-funding-and-the-lending-behavior-of-global-banks,01 Feb 2013,"A striking fact about international financial markets is the large share of dollar-denominated intermediation done by non-US banks. The large footprint of global banks in dollar funding and lending markets raises several important questions. This paper takes the presence of global banks in dollar loan markets as a given, and explores the consequences of this arrangement for cyclical variation in credit supply across countries. In particular, the authors show how shocks to the ability of a foreign bank to raise dollar funding translate into changes in its lending behavior, both in the US and in its home market. Overall, the authors identify a channel through which shocks outside the US can affect the ability of American firms to borrow. Although dollar lending by foreign banks increases the supply of credit to US firms during normal times, it may also prove to be a more fragile source of funding that transmits overseas shocks to the US economy. Key concepts include: Findings show Eurozone banks adjust to strains in wholesale dollar funding markets by borrowing more in euros, but also by cutting back their dollar lending relative to euro lending. Eurozone banks rely on less stable wholesale dollar funding sources to finance their dollar lending whereas a good deal of their euro lending is financed with stickier euro deposits. Frictions in the foreign exchange swap market limit the extent to which Eurozone banks can use euro deposits to fund their dollar lending. As swap demand from Eurozone banks rises, there is only limited arbitrage capital available to take the other side of the trade, which increases the cost of engaging in this synthetic dollar borrowing.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

The main insight is that bankers in developing countries with weak property rights demand rents (such as high barriers to entry) and lax regulation, as a way to compensate them for the political risk they face of being expropriated by the government or used for policy objectives (for example, if the government forces banks to buy its debt). Depositors, on the other hand, demand deposit insurance in case bankers are reckless, while minority shareholders demand high returns to compensate for the risk of insider lending or reckless behavior on the part of bankers. Then, the combination of high barriers to entry, lax regulation, and deposit insurance induces bankers to take on more risks to try to maximize their rents, and does not encourage depositors and minority shareholders to monitor bankers either (as the government limits downside risk for them). This dynamic, in the case of Mexico, led to frequent banking crises between the 1970s and the 1990s. This was the case until 1997, when the government allowed foreign bankers take over the largest domestic commercial banks and improved the monitoring of banks. This increased the stability of the system. There has not been a crisis since then, partly because of improvements in regulation and partly because foreign bankers have been more conservative, not only because they have standardized procedures to deal with risk but also because they are closely monitored by their parent banks abroad. Key concepts include: Stability in the Mexican banking from the 1920s through the 1960s came at a price: Commercial banks could shift risk to government-owned development banks and hence to taxpayers. From the 1970s until 1997, the Mexican banking system was extraordinarily unstable. This was due to the tenuous partnership between the Mexican government and Mexico's bankers. These days, Mexico's foreign bankers have much to lose and little to gain from being opportunistic partners. When the government opened the market, it reformed accounting standards. Mexico's foreign bankers are subject to much greater oversight. Foreign bankers have protections against the Mexican government that Mexican bankers do not have. Regardless of their national origin, Mexico's bankers can no longer be expropriated with the stroke of a pen.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
675,Vulnerable Banks,/item/vulnerable-banks,10 Dec 2012,"Since the beginning of the US financial crisis in 2007, regulators in the United States and Europe have been frustrated by the difficulty in identifying the risk exposures at the largest and most levered financial institutions. Yet, at the time, it was unclear how such data might have been used to make the financial system safer. This paper is an attempt to show simple ways in which this information can be used to understand how deleveraging scenarios could play out. To do so the authors develop and test a model to analyze financial sector stability under different configurations of leverage and risk exposure across banks. They then apply the model to the largest financial institutions in Europe, focusing on banks' exposure to sovereign bonds and using the model to evaluate a number of policy proposals to reduce systemic risk. When analyzing the European banks in 2011, they show how a policy of targeted equity injections, if distributed appropriately across the most systemic banks, can significantly reduce systemic risk. The approach in this paper fits into, and contributes to, a growing literature on systemic risk. Key concepts include: This model can simulate the outcome of various policies to reduce fire sale spillovers in the midst of a crisis. Size caps, or forced mergers among the most exposed banks, do not reduce systemic risk very much. However, modest equity injections, if distributed appropriately between the most systemic banks, can cut the vulnerability of the banking sector to deleveraging by more than half. The model can be adapted to monitor vulnerability on a dynamic basis using factor exposures.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

The authors examine the level of linguistic complexity of more than 11,000 conference call transcripts from non-US firms between 2002 and 2010. Findings show that the linguistic complexity of calls varies with country-level factors such as language barriers, but also with firm characteristics. Firms with more linguistic complexity in their conference calls show less trading volume and price movement following the information releases. Overall, these results may be useful to foreign firms that wish to communicate with investors globally. Analysts and investors around the world may also find the results helpful since they might be able to push managers to speak in a less complex manner. This study is the first to analyze conference calls in a cross-country setting. Key concepts include: Language barriers are a significant determinant of linguistic complexity in foreign firm's information disclosure. Linguistic complexity in information disclosures can be associated with lower information content, as measured by abnormal stock return volatility and trading volume. The effect is significant when there is greater (i) implicit (as captured by the presence of foreign investors) or (ii) explicit (as captured by how actively analysts ask questions) demand for the information disclosure.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

682,Legislating Stock Prices,/item/legislating-stock-prices,15 Aug 2012,"This paper examines the importance of firms' relationships with their legal and political environment, and the actors who form this environment. Governments pass laws that affect firms' competitive landscape, products, labor force, and capital, both directly and indirectly. And yet, it remains difficult to determine which firms any given piece of legislation will affect, and how it will affect them. By observing the actions of legislators whose constituents are the affected firms, the authors gather insights into the likely impact of government legislation on firms. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that legislation has a simple yet previously undetected impact on firm prices. Key concepts include: The measurement of which firms are materially impacted by a given bill is the crux of this paper. Focusing attention on the legislators who have the largest vested interests in firms affected by a given piece of legislation gives a powerful lens into the impact of that legislation on the firms in question. Legislators who have a direct interest in firms often vote quite differently than other, uninterested legislators on legislation that impacts the firms in question. A long-short portfolio based on these legislators' views earns abnormal returns of over 90 basis points per month following the passage of legislation. These returns show no run-up prior to bill passage and no announcement effect directly at bill passage. The returns continue to accrue past the month following passage. The more complex the legislation, the more difficulty the market has in assessing the impact of these bills. The effect the authors document has been becoming stronger over time.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

685,Looking Up and Looking Out: Career Mobility Effects of Demographic Similarity among Professionals,/item/looking-up-and-looking-out-career-mobility-effects-of-demographic-similarity-among-professionals,06 Jul 2012,"While women and racial minorities have increasingly crossed the threshold into professional service organizations, the path to the top remains elusive. Why do inequalities persist? McGinn and Milkman study processes of cohesion, competition, and comparison by looking at career mobility in a single up-or-out professional service organization. Findings show that higher proportions of same-sex and same-race superiors enhanced the career mobility of junior professionals. On the flip side, however, higher proportions of same-sex or same-race peers increased the likelihood of women's and men's exit and generally decreased their chances of promotion. This research highlights how important it is to look at both cooperative and competitive effects of demographic similarity when trying to address the problem of persistent underrepresentation of women and minorities at the highest levels in organizations. Key concepts include: Social comparisons lead to measurable effects on individuals' careers, in turn shaping the demographic composition at the top of professional service organizations. Organizations should attend to the ways in which policies and practices invoke competition and comparison within demographic categories. Clustering same-race or same-sex junior employees to provide an increased sense of community may have the opposite effect of that desired, unless accompanied by senior professionals' active sponsorship of juniors across demographic lines. Attempts to design employment practices that are blind to the demographics of candidates are likely to succeed only if all candidates perceive and receive equal mentoring, sponsorship, and peer support regardless of their race and gender. Among peers, the potentially positive role for social cohesion could be compromised by minimal interaction in day-to-day work, while limited opportunities for choice assignments and promotion lend a distinctly competitive edge to the work environment. Junior professionals perceive that they are easily replaced by peers.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

687,Is a VC Partnership Greater Than the Sum of Its Partners?,/item/is-a-vc-partnership-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-partners,17 May 2012,"Venture capital investments are an important engine of innovation and economic growth, but extremely risky from an individual investor's point of view. Furthermore, there are large differences in fund performance between top quartile and bottom quartile venture capital funds. The ability to consistently produce top performing investments implies that there is something unique and time-invariant about venture capital firms. But to what extent are the important attributes of performance a part of the firm's organizational capital or embodied in the human capital of the people inside the firm? Michael Ewens and Matthew Rhodes-Kropf find that the partner is extremely important. Additionally, results suggest that venture capital partnerships are not much more than the sum of their partners. Partners are often significantly different from each other, but ""good"" firms are those with a group of better partners. Thus, firms that have maintained high performance across many funds may have simply been able to retain high quality partners rather than actually provide those partners with much in the way of fundamental help. Key concepts include: Performance seems almost entirely attributable to the partner, and firm characteristics seem to matter little in venture capital investing. The organizational capital inside a venture capital firm is limited. This would imply limited size firms.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

689,The Stock Selection and Performance of Buy-Side Analysts,/item/the-stock-selection-and-performance-of-buy-side-analysts,20 Mar 2012,"Important differences between buy- and sell-side analysts are likely to affect their behavior and performance. While considerable research during the last twenty years has focused on the performance of sell-side analysts (that is, analysts who work for brokerage firms, investment banks, and independent research firms), much less is known about buy-side analysts (analysts for institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds). This paper examines buy recommendation performance for analysts at a large, buy-side firm relative to analysts at sell-side firms throughout the period of mid-1997 to 2004. The researchers find evidence of differences in the stocks recommended by the buy- and sell-side analysts. The buy-side firm analysts recommended stocks with stock return volatility roughly half that of the average sell-side analyst, and market capitalizations almost seven times larger. These findings indicate that portfolio managers (buy-side analysts' clients) prefer that buy-side analysts cover less volatile and more liquid stocks. The study also finds that the buy-side firm analysts' stock recommendations are less optimistic than their sell-side counterparts, consistent with buy-side analysts facing fewer conflicts of interest. This and future studies may help sell-side and buy-side executives to allocate their financial and human resources more strategically. Key concepts include: The failure to find that buy-side research out-performs that of sell-side analysts raises questions about whether investment firms should continue to rely on their own research rather than using research from sell-side analysts. Buy-side firms' analysts issued recommendations for companies with lower stock return volatility and larger market capitalizations than typical sell-side firms. Buy-side firm analysts recommended stocks with stock return volatility roughly half that of the average sell-side analyst (0.42% versus 0.95%), and market capitalizations almost seven times larger ($9.1 billion versus $1.3 billion). For stocks covered by both buy- and sell-side analysts, there were no differences in the buy recommendations' performance. Resolving whether buy-side research creates value is highly relevant to managers at buy-side firms who are faced with the challenge of allocating limited research resources.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Evidence from Brazil, 2002-2009",/item/what-do-development-banks-do-evidence-from-brazil-2002-2009,24 Jan 2012,"Private firms in developed and developing markets find themselves competing with the so-called ""national champions""—private and state-owned enterprises that receive entitlements, mostly trade protections and/or subsidized credit from the government. Most of these national champions get support by proposing long-term projects with large capital investment that would usually not be easy to fund using private capital. This paper, written by Research by Sergio G. Lazzarini, Aldo Musacchio, Rodrigo Bandeira-de-Mello, and Rosilene Marcon, uses evidence from Brazil to look at what happens to firm performance, investment, and financial expenditures when companies get subsidized credit from the Brazilian National Bank of Economic and Social Development, known as BNDES. Key concepts include: BNDES is one of the largest development banks in the world, but there was no previous comprehensive study tracking the effects of its loans and equity investments. This study finds that BNDES' loans and equity do not seem to affect firm-level operational performance and investment decisions, although the loans and equity do reduce firm-level cost of capital due to the governmental subsidies accompanying loans. Examining the selection process through which BNDES' capital is allocated to firms, the authors find that BNDES apparently selects firms with good operational performance but also provides more capital to firms with political connections (measured as campaign donations to politicians who won an election). Even so, there is no evidence that BNDES is systematically bailing out firms. In general, BNDES appears to be selecting firms with capacity to repay their loans, as regular commercial banks would do.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Securitization and the Incentives for Information Production,/item/are-there-too-many-safe-securities-securitization-and-the-incentives-for-information-production,08 Dec 2011,"Markets for near-riskless securities have suffered numerous shutdowns in the last 40 years, with the recent financial crisis the most prominent example. This suggests that instability could be a general characteristic of such markets, not just a one-time problem associated with the subprime mortgage crisis. Professors Samuel G. Hanson and Adi Sunderam argue that the infrastructure and organization of professional investors are in part determined by the menu of securities offered by originators. Since robust infrastructure is a public good to originators, it may be underprovided in the private market equilibrium. The individually rational decisions of originators may lead to an infrastructure that is overly prone to disruptions in bad times. Policies regulating originator capital structure decisions may help create a more robust infrastructure. Key concepts include: Financial innovations that create near-riskless securities encourage investors to rationally choose to be uninformed. Learning from prior mistakes will not necessarily eliminate the instabilities associated with near-riskless securities. Capital structure regulation in good times can improve welfare. Specifically, it may be desirable to regulate the capital structures of securitization trusts by limiting the amount of AAA-rated debt that can be issued in good times. Informed investors are a robust source of capital capable of analyzing investment opportunities and financing positive NPV (net present value) projects even in bad times.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

695,The Impact of Corporate Sustainability on Organizational Process and Performance,/item/the-impact-of-corporate-sustainability-on-organizational-process-and-performance,14 Nov 2011,"Robert G. Eccles, Ioannis Ioannou, and George Serafeim compared a matched sample of 180 companies, 90 of which they classify as High Sustainability firms and 90 as Low Sustainability firms, in order to examine issues of governance, culture, and performance. Findings for an 18-year period show that High Sustainability firms dramatically outperformed the Low Sustainability ones in terms of both stock market and accounting measures. However, the results suggest that this outperformance occurs only in the long term. Managers and investors who are hoping to gain a competitive advantage in the short term are unlikely to succeed by embedding sustainability in their organization's strategy. Overall, the authors argue that High Sustainability company policies reflect the underlying culture of the organization, where environmental and social performance, in addition to financial performance, are important, but these policies also forge a strong culture by making explicit the values and beliefs that underlie the mission of the organization. Key concepts include: Organizations voluntarily adopting environmental and social policies represent a fundamentally distinct type of modern corporation, characterized by a governance structure that takes into account the environmental and social performance of the company, in addition to financial performance, a long-term approach towards maximizing inter-temporal profits, and an active stakeholder management process. Societal concern about sustainability, at both the level of the firm and society as a whole, has been growing from almost nothing in the early 1990s to rapidly increasing awareness in the early 2000s, to being a dominant theme today. The High Sustainability firms in this study pay attention to their relationships with stakeholders—such as employees, customers, and NGOs representing civil society—through active processes of engagement. The Low Sustainability firms, by contrast, correspond to the traditional model of corporate profit maximization in which social and environmental issues are predominantly regarded as externalities created by firm actions which only need to be addressed if required to do so by law and regulation. The group of firms with a strong sustainability culture is significantly more likely to assign responsibility to its board of directors for sustainability and to form a separate board committee for sustainability. Moreover, High Sustainability companies are more likely to make executive compensation a function of environmental, social, and external perception (e.g., customer satisfaction) metrics.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

So why were the Red Sox an epic failure in 2011? Lackey's lackluster performance is a case study in the perils of chasing superstars, says Professor Boris Groysberg.

In addition to an employee's innate talent, star performance is often also dependent on factors such as organizational culture, networking opportunities, and the general team dynamic. After luring a star performer away from a competitor, it behooves an organization to invest some resources in integrating that person into the new environment.Open for comment; 7 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

In this paper, the authors investigate whether high non-audit services (NAS) fees relative to audit fees are associated with poor quality financial reporting. Associate Professor Suraj Srinivasan and colleagues look specifically at a sample of S&P 500 firms during the years 1978-80. The authors thus provide an early history analysis of a long-standing regulatory concern that NAS fees create an economic dependence that causes the auditor to acquiesce to the client's wishes in financial reporting, reducing the quality of the audit. This concern led the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to prohibit auditors from providing most consulting services. The authors find that, contrary to regulatory concerns, NAS are associated with better quality financial reporting: lower earnings management and higher earnings informativeness. Conclusions rely on the specific institutional features of the years 1978-80. Key concepts include: Providing NAS does not automatically lead to weaker audit quality. Greater information systems consulting fees are associated with higher quality financial reporting for various proxies of earnings quality. This area of consulting likely improved the audit firms' knowledge base, leading to improved audit quality. Evidence suggests that the market does not fear an increase in economic dependence from the non-disclosure of NAS.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
700,The International Politics of IFRS Harmonization,/item/the-international-politics-of-ifrs-harmonization,16 Aug 2011,"Contrary to its staid image in popular culture, accounting has reigned at the forefront of globalization over the last decade. As of 2010, about 100 countries, including all of the world's major economies, either have adopted a common set of accounting principles known as International Financial Reporting Standards, have initiated an IFRS harmonization program, or have in place a national strategy to respond to IFRS. In fact, the proliferation of IFRS worldwide is one of the most important developments in corporate governance today. Through a series of case studies on Canada, China, and India, Assistant Professor Karthik Ramanna analyzes key similarities and differences in the international political dynamics that contribute to countries' responses to IFRS. His framework helps explain and predict countries' decisions on IFRS harmonization, as well as the potential structure and impact of IFRS in the future. Key concepts include: How countries respond to IFRS depends on 1) their access to political power at the IFRS's rule-making body, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which is based in London, and 2) their own direct political power at the IASB. While international politics is not the only or even the deciding element in understanding the growth of IFRS, it is very important. The politics of identity is key in a country's IFRS response strategy. While the Chinese government has been successful in making its voice heard at the IASB, the ability of other emerging markets to do so is less clear, as illustrated by Ramanna's case about India. Ramanna describes the development of IFRS over its first decade, particularly the role of the EU member states and their interests in the establishment and subsequent direction of the IASB.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

This paper examines a situation in which a European bank introduced CLV data to its customer-facing employees, while still maintaining the incentives linked to short-term profitability; the goal was to discover whether and how these employees would modify their mortgage sales decisions. Research was conducted by Pablo Casas-Arce of Universitat Pompeu Fabra, and F. Asís Martínez-Jerez and V.G. Narayanan of Harvard Business School. Key concepts include: Having access to the CLV information caused bank managers to shift their focus toward more profitable client segments. However, the implementation of the CLV metric had no effect on how branch managers decided to price mortgages. Rather, they seemed to increase sales to their most valuable customers just by improving customer service. The availability of the CLV information also did not affect the bank managers' risk-taking tendencies—i.e., they did not relax their standards just to please their most valuable customers. The availability of CLV information led bank managers to cross-sell more products to their mortgage customers by targeting segments that bought a higher average number of products, but there was little effect on the average cross-selling to customers from any given segment.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

To understand how expert influence on strategic thinking can be increased, Matthew Hall, Anette Mikes, and Yuval Millo followed the organizational transformation of risk experts in two large UK banks. One transformation was successful, the other not. Are your experts merely ""box-tickers,"" or are they influential ""frame-makers""? Key concepts include: In the first bank, the transformation of the role of experts was a movement from tacit knowledge, communicable person-to-person, to tools-mediated, highly communicable knowledge that was evident from a variety of organizational documents, practices, and technologies, and embedded in the organization's decision-making processes. These transformed experts, called frame-makers, avoided detaching themselves completely from the resulting knowledge and maintained a high degree of personal involvement in producing analysis and interpretation while participating in executive decision-making. While toolmakers may be successful in becoming frame-makers they might also fall into one of three less influential roles: box-ticker, disconnected technician, or ad hoc advisor.

707,Top Executive Background and Financial Reporting Choice: The Case of Goodwill Impairment,/item/top-executive-background-and-financial-reporting-choice-the-case-of-goodwill-impairment,19 Apr 2011,"In the management literature, some theories hold that corporate actions and strategic choices can be partially predicted by knowing the functional background of executives. The authors provide evidence on how CEOs and CFOs who were former investment bankers, auditors, and private equity/venture capital executives managed decisions around goodwill impairments (essentially goodwill charge-offs)—a complex accounting choice involving a high degree of managerial discretion. Research by HBS professor Francois Brochet and doctoral candidate Kyle Welch. Key concepts include: Results of the research suggest that executive functional background is a significant explanatory factor of goodwill impairment reporting, and that its effect is better understood in the context of upper echelons theory and agency theory. The results can help researchers explore the role of the individual manager in explaining financial reporting choices and also help them to control for executive-level characteristics when investigating determinants of goodwill impairments. Since executive background is an actionable variable for corporate boards, a better understanding of its role in executives' financial reporting choices can be informative to those who monitor executive reporting.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
708,How Do Incumbents Fare in the Face of Increased Service Competition?,/item/how-do-incumbents-fare-in-the-face-of-increased-service-competition,25 Mar 2011,"Companies that compete by offering a high level of service are particularly vulnerable to lose customers—even longtime customers—when competitive entrants offer increased service levels, according to new research in the retail banking industry by Ryan W. Buell, Dennis Campbell, and Frances X. Frei, all of Harvard Business School. The good news for providers of high-touch service is that if they can sustain the service advantage over time, they could be rewarded with higher value customers. Key concepts include: Incumbents offering high quality service attract and retain customers who are disproportionately service sensitive and systematically vulnerable to competitors offering superior service. It is the high quality incumbent's most valuable customers—those with the longest tenure, most products, and highest balances—who are the most vulnerable to superior service alternatives. Conversely, when the incumbent fails to maintain a high service position within the market, its customers are vulnerable to competitors offering inferior service but lower prices. Firms that make the strategic decision not to compete on service may not need to be concerned about the entry or expansion of competitors offering superior service. A long-run implication is that incumbents that can sustain a high level of service relative to local competitors will be able to attract and retain higher value customers over time.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
709,Driven by Social Comparisons: How Feedback about Coworkers’ Effort Influences Individual Productivity,/item/driven-by-social-comparisons-how-feedback-about-coworkers-effort-influences-individual-productivity,16 Mar 2011,"Francesca Gino and Bradley R. Staats explore how the valence (positive versus negative), type (direct versus indirect), and timing (one-shot versus persistent) of performance feedback affects an employee's job productivity. Specifically, through field experiments at a Japanese bank, they investigate the extent to which job performance is affected when employees learn where they stand relative to their coworkers. Key concepts include: Telling an employee that her job performance falls in the bottom of her group will lead that employee to better her performance. But telling her that she is at the top of the group will not significantly affect performance. An indirect approach yields different results. An employee who simply learns that he doesn't fall in the bottom of his group is likely to worsen his productivity, while an employee who simply learns that he isn't in the top of his group is not likely to change his work habits at all. Persistence is effective. Employees who receive persistent feedback from employers are likely to perform better at work than those who don't, and that goes for both positive and negative feedback.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

The challenge is to recalibrate the country's access to credit so that more responsibility for making good loans lies with lenders, and so that the burden is not almost entirely on borrowers.Open for comment; 4 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
711,What’s Government’s Role in Regulating Home Purchase Financing?,/item/whats-governments-role-in-regulating-home-purchase-financing,24 Feb 2011,"The Obama administration recently proposed housing finance reforms to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and bring private capital back to the mortgage markets. HBS professor David Scharfstein and doctoral student Adi Sunderam put forth a proposal to replace Fannie and Freddie and ensure a more stable supply of housing finance. Key concepts include: The two leading types of housing finance reform proposals are 1.) broad-based, explicit, properly priced government guarantees of mortgage-backed securities, and 2.) privatization. Properly priced guarantees would have little effect on mortgage interest rates relative to unguaranteed mortgage credit during normal times, and would expose taxpayers to moral-hazard risk with little benefit. Privatization reduces, but does not eliminate, the government's exposure to mortgage credit risk. It also leaves the economy and financial system exposed to destabilizing boom and bust cycles in mortgage credit. The main goal of housing finance reform should be financial stability, not the reduction of mortgage interest rates. The private market should be the main supplier of mortgage credit, but it should be carefully monitored using new approaches to regulating mortgage securitization. Moreover, the government should play a role of ""guarantor of last resort"" in periods of crisis.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
712,A Behavioral Model of Demandable Deposits and Its Implications for Financial Regulation,/item/a-behavioral-model-of-demandable-deposits-and-its-implications-for-financial-regulation,18 Feb 2011,"Depositors are overconfident of their chances of recovering demandable deposits in a bank run. In a recent research paper, professor Julio J. Rotemberg reviews various government regulations available to be imposed on financial institutions—minimum capital levels, asset requirements, deposit insurance, and compulsory clawbacks—to understand how much they can help protect investors. Key concepts include: US households hold 11.4 percent of their financial assets in ""transactions accounts"" that are immediately available—about $3.5 trillion. Due to cognitive bias, people are overconfident about their position in line to withdraw their deposits in a bank run. Depositors who intend to spend far into the future hold demandable assets because they give investors the opportunity to change their portfolio at will on terms that are determined in advance. The paper offers a justification for various policies that governments use to regulate financial institutions, helping depositors who are too optimistic about how they will fare in a run.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
713,Lawful but Corrupt: Gaming and the Problem of Institutional Corruption in the Private Sector,/item/lawful-but-corrupt-gaming-and-the-problem-of-institutional-corruption-in-the-private-sector,02 Feb 2011,"In the business world, ""gaming"" refers to the act of subverting the intent of rules or laws without technically breaking them--a skillful if unsavory way to achieve private gain. Harvard Business School professor emeritus Malcolm S. Salter explores how gaming the system can lead to institutional corruption, citing examples from Enron and early efforts by some banks to game the implementation of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act. Key concepts include: A Rule-Making Game involves influencing the writing of societal rules such that deliberate loopholes, exclusions, and ambiguous language provide future opportunities for sneaky behavior. A Rule-Following Game involves the actual exploitation of these gaming opportunities. Enron's story includes both types of games. The paper explores three hypotheses. First, extensive lobbying by business interests during rule-making sessions aims not only to minimize regulatory constraints, but also to ensure future gaming opportunities for the firms. Second, the gaming of rules is often fueled by the short-term goals and incentives of both corporate executives and investment managers, ignoring possible long-term consequences. Third, corporate boards become complicit in gaming when they allow gaming to take root and persist as an acceptable organizational norm, and fail to identify and monitor behavior that threatens compliance with socially mandated rules and regulations. Remedying rule-making gaming likely will require policies that address both lobbying efforts and campaign contributions. Meanwhile, extending the decision-making time horizon for investment managers and corporate executives should help to diminish rule-following gaming.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
714,A Brief Postwar History of US Consumer Finance,/item/a-brief-postwar-history-of-us-consumer-finance,27 Jan 2011,"The growth of the consumer finance sector after World War II provided a bevy of new financial options for Americans. These options led to a ""do-it-yourself"" approach to consumer finance, and an increase in household risk taking. In this paper, Harvard Business School professors Gunnar Trumbull and Peter Tufano, along with former HBS research associate Andrea Ryan, discuss the major themes that dominated the expansive postwar sector, including some of the factors that set the stage for the recent subprime mortgage crisis. Key concepts include: The authors identify four major consumer finance trends from the past 65 years: an increase in the number of available financial options including innovations; greater access to those options for more Americans; a trend toward a do-it-yourself approach in consumer financial services; and a resultant increase in household risk taking. The type of debt households carry has changed dramatically over the past several decades. The share of household financial liabilities represented by mortgages increased from 59 percent in 1950 to 73 percent in 2008, while the share represented by consumer debt fell from 31 percent to 18 percent.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
715,Does Shareholder Proxy Access Improve Firm Value? Evidence from the Business Roundtable Challenge,/item/does-shareholder-proxy-access-improve-firm-value-evidence-from-the-business-roundtable-challenge,11 Jan 2011,"In August 2010, the Security and Exchange Commission announced a highly anticipated rule that would make it easier for investors to nominate new board members and get rid of existing ones. It allowed shareholders to have their board candidates included in the company's proxy materials--if those shareholders had owned at least 3 percent of the firm's shares for at least the prior three years. On October 4, the SEC unexpectedly and indefinitely postponed the implementation of that rule, pending the outcome of a lawsuit aimed at overturning it. This paper gauges the significance of the proxy access rule by measuring whether certain firms gained or lost market value on news of the delay. Research was conducted by Harvard Business School professors Bo Becker, Daniel Bergstresser, and Guhan Subramanian. Key concepts include: Firms that would have been most affected by the proxy access rule, based on institutional ownership, lost value on October 4, 2010, following the news of the rule's delay. This suggests that financial markets placed positive value on shareholders' access to the board. The loss in value was greatest at firms that had large positions held by activist investors. The paper's findings may help prove that the SEC has met the federal rule mandating that all proposed rules ""will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.""Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
716,Decoding Inside Information,/item/decoding-inside-information,08 Dec 2010,"Price setters and regulators face a difficult challenge in trying to understand the stock trading activity of corporate insiders, especially when it comes to figuring out whether the activity is a good indicator of the firm's financial future. This National Bureau of Economic Research paper discusses how to distinguish ""routine"" trades (which predict virtually no information about a firm's financial future) from ""opportunistic"" trades (which contain a great deal of predictive power). Research was conducted by Harvard Business School professors Lauren Cohen and Christopher Malloy and Lukasz Pomorski of the University of Toronto. Key concepts include: Routine traders, whose trades make up some 55 percent of insider trades (over half of the universe), are those with a pattern of placing a trade in the same calendar month for at least a few years in a row. Opportunistic traders are those insiders for whom there is no discernible pattern in the past timing of their trades. Focusing solely on opportunistic trading activity allows analysts to weed out useless signals and identify those trades that will likely predict future firm returns and events. More than half of the improvement in this predictive power comes from the superior performance of opportunistic sells relative to routine sells.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
717,Towards an Understanding of the Role of Standard Setters in Standard Setting,/item/towards-an-understanding-of-the-role-of-standard-setters-in-standard-setting,07 Dec 2010,"Accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) play an important role in the development and maintenance of capital markets worldwide, so it is important to understand how these standards come to be. Prior research has focused on the effect of corporate lobbying on the development of FASB standards, but has largely overlooked the role of the FASB members themselves. Looking at these individuals between 1973 and 2007, Harvard Business School doctoral candidate Abigail M. Allen and professor Karthik Ramanna examine how board members' professional experience, length of service on the board, and political leanings influenced accounting standards. Key concepts include: While corporate lobbying is likely to influence the nature of accounting standards proposed by the FASB, the board members themselves are likely to shape Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) by controlling which standards are proposed. Length of service on the board is associated with proposing standards perceived both as more favorable by big auditors and as decreasing accounting ""reliability."" Affiliation with the Democratic Party, measured by political donations, is associated with proposing standards perceived both as less favorable by big auditors and as increasing accounting reliability. The evidence in this study can be used toward building a more comprehensive theory of accounting standard setting, which can be helpful in informing future efforts at designing standard setting institutions, including considerations on term limits and prior work experience.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
718,"Reversing the Null: Regulation, Deregulation, and the Power of Ideas",/item/reversing-the-null-regulation-deregulation-and-the-power-of-ideas,01 Dec 2010,"Who's to blame for the recent financial crisis? To some extent, the fault lies with scholars of economics, according to professor David Moss. In this paper, he argues that an academic focus on government failure in the second half of the 20th century led to the general idea that less was always more when it came to regulation--which, in part, contributed to the crisis. To that end, he calls for a fundamental shift in academic research on the government's role in the economy. Key concepts include: By shifting their focus from market failure to government failure, late-20th-century scholars of economics helped create the impression that government can't get anything right. This helped set the stage for a widespread deregulatory mindset. This mindset was important in helping to eliminate unnecessary regulation, but it also hampered the creation of vital new regulation--including regulation of the largest and most ""systemically significant"" financial institutions--that might have prevented the financial crisis in the first place. The existing null, that government is perfect, has prompted a great deal of work on government failure. Now, Moss suggests, it's time for scholars to try to gain a deeper understanding of when government succeeds and under what conditions. How can well-known sources of government failure, such as regulatory capture, be prevented or minimized? To get there, he says, scholars need to adopt a new null hypothesis--namely, that government always fails. As scholars go about trying to reject that null, they are likely to generate valuable new research on government and regulation, including what works, what doesn't, and why.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

721,How Did Increased Competition Affect Credit Ratings?,/item/how-did-increased-competition-affect-credit-ratings,03 Nov 2010,"When Fitch Ratings took on Standard & Poor's and Moody's as an alternative credit rating agency in the 1990s, there was a general assumption that the increased competition would lead to higher-quality corporate debt ratings from the incumbents. In fact, their ratings quality declined during the 10-year study period, according to Harvard Business School's Bo Becker and Washington University's Todd Milbourn. One possible cause: competition weakens reputational incentives that drive ratings quality. Key concepts include: The entry of a third major rating agency, Fitch, coincided with lower overall quality, as measured by both the levels and the informational content of incumbents' ratings. Prior to Fitch's growth into a serious competitor, S&P and Moody's faced limited competition for rating corporate bonds. A major concern for the raters was maintaining their reputation with investors as providers of honest, accurate ratings. Increasing competition may force raters to compete harder for issuers' business, reducing their focus on the long term and thereby undermining quality. This appears to have been the case with the additional competition from Fitch. Incumbents' ratings became higher and less informative in those industries where Fitch became more prominent as a rater of corporate bonds. For regulators and policymakers, it is worth considering that increasing competition in the ratings industry involves the risk of impairing the reputational mechanism that seemingly brings about the provision of good quality ratings.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

723,Financing Risk and Bubbles of Innovation,/item/financing-risk-and-bubbles-of-innovation,20 Oct 2010,"While start-up firms are key to any technological revolution, they also run a high risk of failure. To that end, investors often provide limited capital in several careful stages, gaining confidence in a firm before doling out another round of funding. However, these investors still face the possibility that other investors won't provide follow-on funding, even when the firm's prospects remain sound. That's a big risk for individual investors who can't afford to fund a new firm all by themselves, and whose investment will flounder if others don't invest, too. Research by HBS professors Ramana Nanda and Matthew Rhodes-Kropf explores why future investors may not fund the project at its next stage even if the fundamentals of the project have not changed. Key concepts include: The paper introduces the concept of financing risk--the risk that a project cannot garner the additional funding it needs to proceed, even if its fundamentals remain sound. When investors become worried, future investors will not support the project. Withdrawing support today leads to a self-fulfilling jump to a poor financing environment. Investors face a trade-off: either providing more capital to novel ideas to protect against financing risk, or providing less funding to maximize knowledge before providing more capital. The most innovative firms face the most acute trade-off situations, and thus, funding to these firms is the most unstable. The additional capital that enters the market during ""hot"" times goes not only to weaker projects, but also to more innovative projects that are a good investment only when financing risk is low. Thus, the most innovative projects may need a hot funding environment to get funding at all.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Key concepts include: Employee selection as an important, but understudied, element of organizational control systems. The research provides the first direct empirical evidence of a link between employee selection and better management control outcomes. Employees chosen by the organization to function well in a decentralized environment were more likely to use decision-making authority in the granting and structuring of consumer loans than those who were not, and made less risky choices.

Key concepts include: There is general agreement that the financing of large financial intermediaries puts the larger financial system at risk.

The government could actively influence the corporate sector's borrowing decisions by shifting its own financing between T-bills and bonds.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
728,Crashes and Collateralized Lending,/item/crashes-and-collateralized-lending,12 Oct 2010,"This paper presents a framework for understanding the contribution of systematic crash risk to the cost of capital for a variety of different types of securities. The framework isolates the systematic crash risk exposure of different collateral types (equities, corporate bonds, and CDO tranches), and provides a simple mechanism for allocating the cost of bearing this risk between a financing intermediary and investor. Research was conducted by Jakub W. Jurek (Bendheim Center for Finance, Princeton University) and Erik Stafford (Harvard Business School). Key concepts include: A typical loan extended by a broker to an investor for a purchase on margin is collateralized by the underlying security and protected by the investor's capital contribution (the collateral, margin, or ""haircut""). The haircut protects the intermediary from changes in the liquidation value of the collateral. The researchers' focus is looking at haircuts as an effective protection against large market declines. They derive a schedule of haircuts and financing rates (spreads above the risk-free rate), which represents the intermediary's fair charge for providing leverage to the investor. The framework also can be used to stress test different types of collateral by examining the predicted financing terms as market conditions change. This systematic credit risk channel has not been explored in the banking literature, despite the growing role of collateralized borrowing in the economy (e.g. repo market) and the seeming relevance of ensuring collateral robustness in adverse economic states.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Research, which focused on a loan-application processing line at a Japanese bank, was conducted by HBS professor Francesca Gino and Kenan-Flagler Business School assistant professor Bradley R. Staats. Key concepts include: Even taking acclimation into account, a worker's productivity will improve immediately after switching from one task to another, so it behooves managers to introduce a variety of tasks into the workday. All else being equal, workers perform better during the first half of the day than the second half. Productivity improves markedly when workers are given the incentive of leaving as soon as the day's tasks are completed.

Their work explores how CSR strategies can affect value creation in public equity markets through analyst recommendations. Key concepts include: Top executives and managers interested in implementing CSR strategies in their organizations know that negative analysts' reactions, and subsequent value destruction in capital markets is a real possibility when they initially attempt to implement such strategies. Managers should be aware that not only what is communicated matters but also to whom it is communicated in the investment community. Research analysts differ in their ability to understand the implications of CSR. Among theoretical contributions, the research integrates diverse theoretical streams and offers the first empirical piece of evidence about how CSR strategies are perceived as value-creating by an important information intermediary: sell-side analysts. The work also integrates the CSR management literature with a large body of research in accounting and finance, to shed light on aspects of CSR activity for which little is known and much less is being understood; namely, the channels and the mechanisms through which the CSR impact is perceived and realized in public equity markets.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
731,"Foreign Entry and the Mexican Banking System, 1997-2007",/item/foreign-entry-and-the-mexican-banking-system-1997-2007,21 Jul 2010,"What are the effects of foreign bank entry in developing economies? In recent years, governments around the world have been opening up their banking systems to foreign competition. In Mexico, for example, the market share of foreign ownership of banks increased fivefold between 1997 and 2007. In this paper, Stanford professor Stephen Haber and HBS professor Aldo Musacchio describe their detailed study of the impact of foreign entry in Mexico during that period. Overall, results suggest that while foreign entry in Mexico is associated with greater stability of the banking system, it has not increased the availability of credit, and foreign entry is not a solution to a property rights environment that makes contract enforcement costly. Key concepts include: Foreign entry in Mexico is associated with greater banking system stability. Foreign entry, however, has not increased the availability of credit. Mexican banks that were sold to foreign multinationals were invested in housing loans with a high risk of default and a low rate of interest. Foreign purchasers appear to have shifted the loan portfolio away from these investments. However, foreign entry, whether by mergers and acquisitions or by greenfield banks, has not led to an increase in financial intermediation. At the end of 1997, GDP was 18 percent, and 12 years later it had grown to only 23 percent, low by any comparative standard. In Mexico, foreign entry is not a solution to a property rights environment that makes contract enforcement costly.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
732,Cyclicality of Credit Supply: Firm Level Evidence,/item/cyclicality-of-credit-supply-firm-level-evidence,01 Jul 2010,"Bank lending falls in economic recessions. In particular, it shrank considerably during the recent economic downturn. Does such cyclicality of bank lending reflect a decline in banks' willingness to lend (the ""loan supply"" effect) or reduced demand for loans from firms (the ""loan demand"" effect)? The considerable attention that is given to banks' financial health by the Federal Reserve, Congress, and other branches of government is only warranted if the answer is supply. Focusing on U.S. firms that raised new debt financing between 1990 and 2009, HBS professors Bo Becker and Victoria Ivashina demonstrate that many large U.S. firms turn to the bond market when banks are in poor financial health. When times are better, the same firms get bank loans. Becker and Ivashina argue that the substitution between bonds and loans at the firm-level is a good economic proxy for the bank credit supply. Key concepts include: The incidence of bank loans, as compared to bonds, is very cyclical. Firms getting a bank loan are likely to stay with that form of debt in the near future. The pattern is similar in most years. But when banks are doing poorly, this pattern is reversed, and many large firms who would typically turn to banks for debt financing, instead issue bonds. The loan-and-bond mix for large firms is a strong predictor of a likelihood of firms without access to bond markets to raise bank debt.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
733,“An Unfair Advantage”? Combining Banking with Private Equity Investing,/item/an-unfair-advantage-combining-banking-with-private-equity-investing,24 Jun 2010,"Does the combination of banking and private equity investing endow banks with superior information that allows them to identify good prospects and garner superior returns? Or does the combination bestow banks with an unfair ability to expand their balance sheets, capturing benefits within the bank at the expense of the overall market and ultimately the taxpayers? INSEAD's Lily Fang and Harvard Business School professors Victoria Ivashina and Josh Lerner examined nearly 8,000 unique private equity transactions between 1978 and 2009, looking in depth at the nature of the private equity investors, the structure of the investments, and the performance of the firms. Collectively, findings suggest that there are risks in combining banking and private equity investing. The results are consistent with many of the worries about these transactions articulated by policymakers. Key concepts include: The cyclicality of bank-affiliated transactions, the time-varying pattern of the financing benefit enjoyed by affiliated deals, and the generally worse outcomes of these deals done at market peaks raise questions about the desirability of combining banking with private equity investing. These investments seem to exacerbate the amplitude of waves in the private equity market, leading to more transactions at precisely the times when the private and social returns are likely to be the lowest. Investments involving both affiliated and nonaffiliated firms appear particularly vulnerable to downturns. Some information-related synergies, however, are captured internally by the banks. But banks' involvement poses significant issues as well. The share of banks in the private equity market is substantial. Between 1983 and 2009, over one-quarter of all private equity investments involved bank-affiliated private equity groups.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

735,Just Say No to Wall Street: Putting A Stop to the Earnings Game,/item/just-say-no-to-wall-street-putting-a-stop-to-the-earnings-game,13 May 2010,"Over the last decade, companies have struggled to meet analysts' expectations. Analysts have challenged the companies they covered to reach for unprecedented earnings growth, and executives have often acquiesced to analysts' increasingly unrealistic projections, adopting them as a basis for setting goals for their organizations. As Monitor Group cofounder Joseph Fuller and HBS professor emeritus Michael C. Jensen write, improving future relations between Main Street and Wall Street and putting an end to the destructive ""earnings game"" between analysts and executives will require a new approach to disclosure based on a few simple rules of engagement. (This article originally appeared in the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance in the Winter 2002 issue.) Key concepts include: Managers must confront the capital markets with courage and conviction. Managers must be forthright and promise only those results they have a legitimate prospect of delivering, and they must be clear about the risks and uncertainties involved. Managers must recognize that an overvalued stock can be damaging to the long-run health of the company, particularly when it serves as a pretext for overpriced acquisitions. Managers must work to make their organizations more transparent to investors and to the markets. To limit wishful thinking, managers must reconcile their own company's projections to those of the industry and their rivals. While recent history may have obscured the analyst role, managers should not simply presume that analysts are wrong when disagreement occurs. In fact, analysts have a vital monitoring role to play in a market economy.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

But results include less competition and increased risk to taxpayers. A Q&A from the HBS Alumni Bulletin and book excerpt from Too Big to Save? Key concepts include: Most of the 600 institutions recapitalized by the federal government over the last year do not satisfy basic bailout criterion. The U.S. needs to get loan securitization going because that's what drives loan volume. The Fed should not be the primary risk regulator. Splitting troubled institutions into two banks is a better approach than creating heavily subsidized public-private partnerships to try to buy toxic assets.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
737,Shareholders Need a Say on Pay,/item/shareholders-need-a-say-on-pay,02 Nov 2009,"""Say on pay"" legislation now under debate Washington D.C. can be a useful tool for shareholders to strengthen the link between CEO pay and performance when it comes to golden parachutes, says Harvard Business School professor Fabrizio Ferri. Here's a look at how the collective involvement of multiple stakeholders could shape the future of executive compensation. Key concepts include: ""Say on pay"" means shareholders hold an annual advisory vote on executive pay based on a report prepared by the firm's board of directors. Say on pay might create more communication and awareness between shareholders and boards because it forces both entities to grapple with an extremely complex issue. Ferri advocates tailoring executive pay to a company's individual circumstances.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

739,"Banking Deregulations, Financing Constraints and Firm Entry Size",/item/banking-deregulations-financing-constraints-and-firm-entry-size,11 Sep 2009,"How do financing constraints on new start-ups affect the initial size of these new firms? Since bank debt comprises the majority of U.S. firm borrowings, new ventures are especially sensitive to local bank conditions due to their limited options for external finance. Liberalization in the banking sector can thus have important effects on entrepreneurship in product markets. As HBS professors William Kerr and Ramana Nanda explain, the 1970s through the mid-1990s was a period of significant liberalization in the ability of banks to establish branches and to expand across state borders, either through new branches or through acquisitions. Using a database of annual employment data for every U.S. establishment from 1976 onward, Kerr and Nanda examine how U.S. branch banking deregulations impacted the entry size of new start-ups in the non-financial sector. This paper is closely related to their prior work examining how the deregulations impacted the rates of startup entry and exit in the non-financial sector. Key concepts include: The average entry size for start-ups did not change following the bank deregulations. However, this result masks the differences in entry size among startups that failed within three years of entry and those that survived for four years or more. Start-ups that survived for four years or longer entered at 2% larger sizes after the deregulations compared to earlier periods. Entrants that failed within three years did not enter at larger firm sizes. It is a challenge to measure accurately changes in the initial size of new firms even using micro-data such as that from the U.S. Census Bureau. Carefully characterizing effects of financing constraints on the initial size of new firms theoretically and empirically is an important research topic for entrepreneurial finance.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
740,Information Risk and Fair Value: An Examination of Equity Betas and Bid-Ask Spreads,/item/information-risk-and-fair-value-an-examination-of-equity-betas-and-bid-ask-spreads,02 Sep 2009,"What is the role of fair values in the current economic crisis? The interplay between information risk—that is, uncertainty regarding valuation parameters for an underlying asset—and the reporting of financial instruments at fair value has been a subject of high-level policy debate. Finance theory suggests that information risk is reflected in firms' equity betas and the information asymmetry component of bid-ask spreads. HBS professor Edward Riedl and doctoral candidate George Serafeim test predictions for a sample of large U.S. banks, exploiting recent mandatory disclosures of financial instruments designated as fair value level 1, 2, and 3, which indicate progressively more illiquid and opaque financial instruments. Overall, banks with higher exposures to level 3 financial assets have both higher equity betas and higher bid-ask spreads. Both results are consistent with higher levels of information risk, and thus cost of capital, for these firms. Key concepts include: Banks with higher exposure to level 3 (or more illiquid) financial assets reflect higher information risk, revealed both in higher equity betas and higher bid-ask spreads. This is suggestive that current disclosures surrounding level 3 financial instruments are insufficient to mitigate investor perceptions of greater information risk for highly opaque financial assets. The regulatory implications may include enhancements to the disclosures (particularly for level 3 financial instruments), as well as increased movement towards risk-weighted regulatory capital.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
741,Why Competition May Not Improve Credit Rating Agencies,/item/why-competition-may-not-improve-credit-rating-agencies,31 Aug 2009,"Competition usually creates better products and services. But when competition increased among credit rating agencies, the result was less accurate ratings, according to a study by HBS professor Bo Becker and finance professor Todd Milbourn of Washington University in St Louis. In our Q&A, Becker discusses why users of ratings should exercise a little caution. Key concepts include: Competition in credit ratings forces raters to favor issuers. This is contrary to the interest of those who rely on ratings to make investment decisions or to regulate. There are 10 nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations. The big 3 are Fitch, Standard and Poor's (S&P), and Moody's. Fitch used to be much smaller, but over the past decade has become a peer of S&P and Moody's. Becker and Milbourn used the appearance of Fitch to test for the effect of competition on corporate bond ratings. Policymakers should proceed cautiously when trying to increase competition among raters, and be aware of the potential drawbacks. If you really want to know the value of a security, there is no shortcut to doing the work yourself.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
742,The Impact of Private Equity Ownership on Portfolio Firms’ Corporate Tax Planning,/item/the-impact-of-private-equity-ownership-on-portfolio-firms-corporate-tax-planning,28 Aug 2009,"Although private firms are important components of the U.S. economy, their tax practices remains largely unknown due to the lack of publicly available financial information. In recent years, private equity (PE) firms have been broadly criticized based on the substantial tax benefits enjoyed by their owners and managers. Editorials have inflamed public opinion by accusing PE firm owners and managers as having excessively low tax rates, and pointing out that the substantial wealth generated by PE firms can ""pay for sophisticated tax planning,"" including the use of offshore investment companies based in tax havens. More generally, critics contend that PE firms aggressively manage their tax liabilities and those of their portfolio companies. This study investigates the latter contention. In particular, the authors look at whether private companies that are majority-owned by PE firms (""majority PE-backed firms"") engage in more tax avoidance than other publicly traded and privately held firms. This may be the first study to compare the tax practices of firms with different private ownership structures. Key concepts include: While majority PE-backed private firms significantly benefit from the tax shield generated by leverage, they otherwise appear less tax aggressive than public firms. In contrast, private firms that are majority-owned by PE firms engage in more tax avoidance than both management-owned and minority PE-backed private firms. On average, majority PE-backed firms pay 15 cents less income tax per dollar of pretax income than other privately held firms, even after controlling for losses and debt tax shields.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
743,Reputation and Competition: Evidence from the Credit Rating Industry,/item/reputation-and-competition-evidence-from-the-credit-rating-industry,22 Jul 2009,"Credit ratings are a key aspect of the financial system. The quality of these ratings is certainly sustained in part by the reputational concerns of rating agencies, whose paying customers have no inherent interest in the quality of ratings. Competition in this industry has been increasing, and there have been calls for yet more competition. Whether competition will reduce quality or improve it is not yet clear. HBS professor Bo Becker and Washington University in St. Louis professor Todd Milbourn test these conflicting predictions in the ratings industry. Their evidence is more or less consistent with a reduction in credit rating quality as Fitch increased its market presence. Their empirical findings suggest that the system will work better when competition is not too severe. These results have potential policy implications. Key concepts include: Competition is associated with ""friendlier"" ratings. For regulators, it is worth considering that increasing competition in the ratings industry involves the risk of impairing the reputational mechanism that underlies the provision of good quality ratings. For bond markets, it is clear that relying on third party ratings paid for by issuers is not a system without risks.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
744,Why Do Countries Adopt International Financial Reporting Standards?,/item/why-do-countries-adopt-international-financial-reporting-standards,25 Jun 2009,"Why do some countries adopt the European Union (EU)-based International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) when others do not? To expand our understanding of the determinants and consequences of IFRS adoption on a global sample, HBS professor Karthik Ramanna and MIT Sloan School of Management coauthor Ewa Sletten studied variations over time in the decision to adopt these standards in more than a hundred non-EU countries. Understanding countries' adoption decisions can provide insights into the benefits and costs of IFRS adoption. Key concepts include: Countries with high quality corporate governance systems and more powerful countries are less likely to adopt IFRS. There are network benefits to IFRS adoption, i.e., the likelihood of IFRS adoption for a given country increases with the number of IFRS adopters in its geographical region and with IFRS adoption among its trade partners. As more countries adopt the international standards, the relative import of network benefits from IFRS adoption (over direct economic benefits) are likely to increase. Similar effects might be seen in the adoption of accounting methods and standards, and of corporate governance best practices by firms and jurisdictions.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Congress can put an end to such costly rescues, says HBS professor David A. Moss, and the Federal Reserve could be a super regulator, adds senior lecturer Robert C. Pozen. But will Congress enact the regulatory cure that is required? From the HBS Alumni Bulletin. Key concepts include: No firm should be too big to fail. The federal government should slap tough new regulations on all firms that pose ""systemic risk""—the risk that a failure of one institution could wreak havoc across the entire financial system. The majority of financial firms that pose no systemic risk should face relatively light regulation, ensuring their continued dynamism and innovation. Not everyone on the politically divided Congressional Oversight Panel agrees with Moss's analysis and recommendations. The general concept of regulating systemic risk has gained broad support from a wide range of influential economists, lawmakers, and interest groups.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

747,Can a Continuously-Liquidating Tontine (or Mutual Inheritance Fund) Succeed where Immediate Annuities Have Floundered?,/item/can-a-continuously-liquidating-tontine-or-mutual-inheritance-fund-succeed-where-immediate-annuities-have-floundered,04 Jun 2009,"The changeover from defined benefit to defined contributions retirement plans in the United States has created a vast group of individuals that faces (or will face) the difficult problem of using a lump sum of assets to provide consumption for a relatively long but uncertain number of years. Up to this point, however, consumers appear not to have embraced annuitization. HBS professor Julio J. Rotemberg suggests an alternative instrument that, like immediate annuities, provides longevity insurance and postpones income until old age. In the proposed Mutual Inheritance Fund (MIF), a pool is formed by having individuals of a particular age buy shares in a mutual fund. The income from the underlying assets in the mutual fund is reinvested in the fund so that the value of the shares in an individual's name (and possibly also the number of these shares) grows over time. The basic idea behind the MIF is that the shares of pool members who die are liquidated, and the proceeds are then distributed in cash to the remaining members in proportion to the number of mutual fund shares that are currently in their name. Key concepts include: The essence of the MIF is that people within a pool are bequeathing benefits to each other. The commonality of purpose among the members of the pool, inherent in the MIF, fits with the ""mutual insurance"" idea with which a great deal of insurance was started. The MIF might be more successful when the members of a pool have some reason to feel altruism toward each other (perhaps because they worked for the same organization). This altruism may be able to counteract an aspect of annuities that potential contributors customers dislike, namely, that they ""get nothing"" after they die. The MIF suggests an implicit concern for direct descendants. While annuities are sometimes seen as robbing children of their inheritance, the strong tilt of the MIF toward old age leads to a lottery-like component where heirs have a good chance to inherit some of the tontine's proceeds if a contributor policyholder survives until old age.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

749,Money or Knowledge? What Drives Demand for Financial Services in Emerging Markets?,/item/money-or-knowledge-what-drives-demand-for-financial-services-in-emerging-markets,15 May 2009,"Why is there apparently limited demand for financial services in emerging markets? On the one hand, low-income individuals may not want formal services when informal savings, credit, and insurance markets function reasonably well, and the benefits of formal financial market participation may not exceed the costs. On the other hand, limited financial literacy could be the barrier: If people are not familiar or comfortable with products, they will not demand them. These two views carry significantly different implications for the development of financial markets around the world, and would suggest quite different policy decisions by governments and international organizations seeking to promote ""financial deepening."" HBS professor Shawn Cole and coauthors found that financial literacy education has no effect on the probability of opening a bank savings account for the full population, although it does significantly increase the probability among those with low initial levels of financial literacy and low levels of education. In contrast, modest financial subsidies significantly increase the share of households that open a bank savings account within the subsequent two months. Key concepts include: Subsidies or price reductions may represent a more cost-effective way of drawing households into the financial system. Financial literacy efforts targeted at the general population may be relatively ineffective. These results do not necessarily constitute support for financial literacy education even among the low-literacy subpopulation. Even if financial literacy programs are carefully targeted, they may still not be cost-effective.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

751,An Ounce of Prevention: The Power of Public Risk Management in Stabilizing the Financial System,/item/an-ounce-of-prevention-the-power-of-public-risk-management-in-stabilizing-the-financial-system,04 May 2009,"The present financial crisis should remind us that private financial institutions and markets cannot always be counted upon to manage risk optimally on their own. Almost everyone now recognizes that the government has a critical role to play—as the lender, insurer, and spender of last resort—in times of crisis. But effective public risk management is also needed in normal times to protect consumers and investors and to help prevent financial crises from starting in the first place. According to HBS professor David Moss, the biggest threat to our financial system today is posed not by commercial banks (as in 1933), but rather by systemically significant institutions (outside of commercial banking) that have the potential to trigger financial avalanches. The threat posed by these financial institutions is only compounded by the unprecedented federal guarantees introduced in response to the current crisis and the pervasive moral hazard they spawn. Under the system that Moss proposes, no financial institution would be too big to fail. Key concepts include: Ensure financial stability in the future by identifying and regulating systemically significant institutions on an ongoing basis, before crisis strikes. The biggest risk management problem we face today in the financial sector is not commercial banks, but rather systemically significant institutions that pose a threat to the broader financial system (because of their size and interconnectedness) and, as a result, carry implicit federal guarantees. The fifty years of relative financial calm that followed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Banking Act of 1935 strongly suggest that sound public risk management can make a positive difference. To the extent that systematically significant financial institutions will receive federal support in the event of a general financial crisis, such support should be formalized (and paid for) in advance. Although all government guarantees can generate moral hazard, implicit guarantees are often the worst kind.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
752,Earnings Quality and Ownership Structure: The Role of Private Equity Sponsors,/item/earnings-quality-and-ownership-structure-the-role-of-private-equity-sponsors,30 Apr 2009,"Although 99 percent of the companies operating in the United States are private, according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, their accounting practices remain largely unknown due mainly to the lack of publicly available financial statements. In this study, HBS professor Sharon P. Katz used a unique database of firms with privately held equity and publicly held debt to examine how two different ownership structures-private equity sponsorship and non-private equity sponsorship-affect firms' financial reporting practices, financial performance, and stock returns in the years preceding and following the initial public offering (IPO). Key concepts include: Despite their economic importance and the management expertise they bring, little is known about the role private equity (PE) sponsors play in their portfolio companies' accounting practices. The presence of and monitoring by PE sponsors restrains upward earnings management and induces a higher frequency of timely loss recognition, both pre- and post-IPO. Majority ownership by a PE sponsor is associated with better stock price performance relative to management-owned firms. Larger PE sponsor size is positively associated with better long-term financial and stock price performance when a firm goes public.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
753,Female Empowerment: Impact of a Commitment Savings Product in the Philippines,/item/female-empowerment-impact-of-a-commitment-savings-product-in-the-philippines,29 Apr 2009,"Does access to personal savings increase female decision-making power in the household? The answer could be important for policymakers looking to increase female empowerment. HBS professor Nava Ashraf and colleagues developed a commitment savings product called a SEED (Save, Earn, Enjoy Deposits) account with a small, rural bank in the Philippines. The SEED account requires that clients commit not to withdraw funds that are in the account until they reach a goal date or amount, but it does not explicitly commit the client to continue depositing funds after opening the account. This working paper examines the impact of the commitment savings product on both self-reported decision-making processes within the household and the subsequent household allocation of resources. Key concepts include: The commitment savings product positively impacts household decision-making power for women (i.e., the household is more likely to buy female-oriented durables) and self-perception of savings behavior (time-inconsistent females report being more disciplined savers), as well as actual consumption decisions regarding durable goods. A simple design feature such as a restriction on withdrawals or encouraging savings through marketing or door-to-door deposits can benefit women in search of self-control devices as well as those who desire to have more decision-making power in the household.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
754,The Investment Strategies of Sovereign Wealth Funds,/item/the-investment-strategies-of-sovereign-wealth-funds,17 Apr 2009,"The role of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in the global financial system has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and many reports suggest that SWFs are often employed to further the geopolitical and strategic economic interests of their governments. The resources controlled by these funds—estimated to be $3.5 trillion in 2008—have grown sharply over the past decade. Projections, while inherently tentative due to the uncertainties about the future path of economic growth and commodity prices, suggest that they will be increasingly important actors in the years to come. Despite this significant and growing role, financial economists have devoted remarkably little attention to these funds. The lack of scrutiny must be largely attributed to the deliberately low profile adopted by many SWFs, which makes systematic analysis challenging. Bernstein, Lerner, and Schoar analyze how SWFs vary in their investment styles and performance across various geographies and governance structures. Taken as a whole, results suggest that high levels of home investments by SWFs, particularly those with the active involvement of political leaders, are associated with trend chasing and worse performance. Key concepts include: Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) present an ideal object of investigation to understand the interaction between finance and political economy. The direct private equity investments analyzed here are one of the few dimensions of SWF investments on which it is possible to obtain comprehensive information. SWFs seem to engage in a form of trend chasing, since they are more likely to invest at home when domestic equity prices are higher, and invest abroad when foreign prices are higher. SWFs where politicians are involved have a much greater likelihood of investing at home than those where external managers are involved. Funds with politicians involved invest in higher P/E (price earnings ratio) industries, which have a negative valuation change in the year after the investment. Much research remains to better understand the underlying investment objectives of SWFs, their investment strategies, and their organizational differences, as well as the constraints they face due to internal and external pressures.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

This line of research has contributed to organizational theory by showing the importance of state action for constructing economic systems, as well as firm structures and strategies. But there are a number of reasons why this perspective may in fact overemphasize the importance of public policy. This working paper, forthcoming as an article in the Academy of Management Journal, more fully investigates the contingent nature of the effects of policy on organizations, with the orienting premise that policy is just one of the external conditions that organizations face, and policy effects are more or less powerful to the extent that they are interactive with other elements of the environment. Specifically, the authors focus on how policy that regulated bank branching and other environmental factors affected—independently as well as interactively—the emergence and growth of large-scale firms in U.S. commercial banking from 1896 to 1978.

HBS professors Joshua D. Coval and Erik Stafford, with Princeton colleague Jakub Jurek, authors of a new paper, have ideas. Key concepts include: Over the past decade, risks have been repackaged to create triple-A-rated securities. Even modest imprecision in estimating underlying risks is magnified disproportionately when securities are pooled and tranched, as shown in a modeling exercise. Ratings of structured finance products, which make no distinction between the different sources of default risk, are particularly useless for determining prices and fair rates of compensation for these risks. Going forward, it would be best to eliminate any sanction of ratings as a guide to investment policy and capital requirements. It is important to focus on measuring and judging the system's aggregate amount of leverage and to understand the exposures that financial institutions actually have.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

The Effects of Education, Financial Literacy and Cognitive Ability on Financial Market Participation."") Individuals face an increasingly complex menu of financial product choices. The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pension plans, and the growing importance of private retirement accounts, require individuals to choose the amount they save, as well as the mix of assets in which they invest. Yet, participation in financial markets is far from universal in the United States. Moreover, researchers have only a limited understanding of what factors cause participation. Cole and Shastry use a very large dataset new to the literature in order to study the important determinants of financial market participation. They find that higher levels of education and cognitive ability cause increased participation—however, financial literacy education does not. Key concepts include: The relationship between education and savings is difficult to measure, because both are affected by many factors (motivation, ability, etc.). This paper documents an important causal relationship between education and financial market participation. A set of financial literacy education programs, mandated by state governments, did not have an effect on individual savings decisions. It is imperative to conduct rigorous evaluations of financial literacy education programs to measure their efficacy.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
760,Market Reaction to the Adoption of IFRS in Europe,/item/market-reaction-to-the-adoption-of-ifrs-in-europe,10 Dec 2008,"How do investors in European firms react to a change in financial reporting? Prior to 2005, most European firms applied domestic accounting standards. The adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) would result in the application of a common set of financial reporting standards within Europe, and between Europe and the many other countries that require or permit application of IFRS. However, modification of IFRS by European regulators would result in European standards differing from those used in other countries, thereby eliminating some potential convergence benefits. This study investigates the equity market reaction to 16 events associated with the adoption of IFRS in Europe. Overall, the researchers' findings are consistent with investors expecting the benefits associated with IFRS adoption in Europe to exceed the expected costs. Key concepts include: Overall, investors reacted positively to the increased likelihood of IFRS adoption. Investors expected net benefits associated with increases in information quality, decreases in information asymmetry, more rigorous enforcement of the standards, and convergence. The reaction for firms domiciled in code law countries is less positive, consistent with investors' concerns over enforcement of IFRS in those countries.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Agricultural Credit in India,/item/fixing-market-failures-or-fixing-elections-agricultural-credit-in-india,06 Aug 2008,"There are strong theoretical reasons to believe that politicians manipulate resources under their control to achieve electoral success. Yet, compelling examples of this manipulation are heretofore rarely documented in scholarly literature. Cole's paper presents evidence that government-owned banks in India serve the electoral interests of politicians. It also analyzes how resources are strategically distributed. Key concepts include: Findings show that the costs of redistribution are considerable: The estimated effect of 5 to 10 percent higher levels of credit in election years is substantially larger than the average annual growth rate of credit. Efforts to isolate government banks from political pressure, as is done with many central banks, may reduce these effects. Agricultural credit lent by public banks is substantially higher in election years. More loans are made in ""swing"" districts in which the ruling state party had a narrow margin of victory (or a narrow loss) than in less competitive districts. This targeting is not observed in nonelection years or in private bank lending.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

According to HBS professor Boris Groysberg, star women place greater emphasis than men on external business relationships, and conduct better research on potential employers. Plus: Businesswomen are asked to share career experiences. Key concepts include: Star women performers invest more in external than in in-house relationships. They also tend to do far more due diligence than men when they receive a job offer. Organizations that deliberately set out to create female-friendly environments seem to reap a competitive advantage. Women in a male-dominated industry realize that they are vulnerable, but men are also vulnerable to bad management and cultural mismatches more than they realize.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
765,"Financial Development, Bank Ownership, and Growth. Or, Does Quantity Imply Quality?",/item/financial-development-bank-ownership-and-growth-or-does-quantity-imply-quality,22 Jul 2008,"Government ownership of banks, a common phenomenon, is among the most important policy tools used to influence financial development. But what is the actual effect of such ownership on the financial development of a country? This paper uses a policy experiment in India to evaluate the effect of government ownership of banks on development. Key concepts include: Had the Indian government required bank expansion into rural areas and set lending targets, without nationalizing banks, rural areas might have achieved the same, or better, outcomes. Despite a substantial increase in agricultural credit, there is no evidence of improved agricultural outcomes in markets with nationalized banks. Bank nationalization may have slowed the growth of employment in the more developed sectors of trade and services.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

767,Bank Structure and the Terms of Lending to Small Businesses,/item/bank-structure-and-the-terms-of-lending-to-small-businesses,24 Jun 2008,"Access to ""soft information"" and the greater sensitivity of decentralized banks to the local institutional environment can have both positive and negative consequences for small firms. Hence there may be a dark side to decentralized bank lending in certain instances. This paper argues that the same ability of decentralized banks to act on soft information also makes them more responsive to the local environment when setting terms of their loans. While this can be beneficial for small businesses in competitive markets, it also implies that the organizational structure of decentralized banks might allow them to better exploit their market power in concentrated banking markets by restricting credit or charging higher interest rates from small businesses. Key concepts include: According to the findings, small firms and those with greater ""soft information"" were more likely to get larger loans from decentralized banks, particularly in environments where the legal enforcements of financial contracts were relatively weak. On the other hand, decentralized banks were also more likely than centralized banks to cherry-pick the best firms, give smaller loans, and charge higher interest rates in concentrated banking markets. The relative benefit of decentralized bank structures for small business lending may therefore depend critically on the institutional and competitive environment in which banks are located. Public policy should consider promoting competition between decentralized banks in order to truly achieve the benefits associated with credit access for small businesses or those with more ""soft information.""Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

As Tufano describes in this Q&A, different solutions appeal to different people. Here's what government policy, the private sector, and nonprofits can do. Key concepts include: A variety of levers can be used to support people who want to save (not to force someone to save who doesn't want to). Some levers are simple changes that make the process of savings easier. Other levers involve providing various incentives, be they financial or sociological.

769,Using Financial Innovation to Support Savers: From Coercion to Excitement,/item/using-financial-innovation-to-support-savers-from-coercion-to-excitement,23 Jun 2008,"This paper acknowledges the wide range of solutions to the problem of low family savings. Families, and of particular interest to the authors, low-income families, save for a wide variety of purposes, including identifiable reasons such as education and retirement and others that are more broad, like rainy days or emergencies. Given societal pressures to consume, and given the diversity among people, it is unlikely that there is a single solution to the savings problem. Yet a number of programs described by Tufano and Schneider have great promise in supporting household savings. Tufano and Schneider discuss each program from the perspectives of would-be savers as well as from that of other key stakeholders. Key concepts include: Researchers must be sensitive to the needs of low- and moderate-income families, whose concerns about having the resources to cope with short-term emergencies are just as legitimate as needs to plan for a retirement that may be decades away. The continuum of solutions highlighted in this paper ranges from those that force families to save (coercion) to others that seek to work consumers into a frenzy about savings (excitement). These varied solutions emphasize different elements of human behavior or impediments to savings. Some solutions to low savings require massive government policy, some require small changes in existing regulations, and still others are completely market oriented. Some require large subsidies, while others might be profitable on their own.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
770,Accounting Information as Political Currency,/item/accounting-information-as-political-currency,19 Jun 2008,"The study of accounting and the political process has long been viewed through the political cost hypothesis, the basic premise of which is that firms manage earnings in order to extract first-order benefits (or avoid first-order costs) from regulators. This paper develops and tests a distinct, yet likely, complementary hypothesis: Firms manage reported earnings in order to supply first-order benefits to regulators. Focusing on Democratic and Republican candidates in congressional races in 2004, Ramanna and Roychowdhury test whether the management of accounting information is in some circumstances akin to a political contribution from firms to politicians: in other words, whether accounting information can be used as political currency. The authors predict and find that identified corporate donors to candidates in closely watched races in 2004 managed information related to outsourcing, a hot-button issue in those races. Key concepts include: While corporate donors in general do not exhibit evidence of downward earnings management, corporate donors to candidates in closely watched congressional races exhibit significant evidence of downward earnings management in the second and third quarters of 2004. The evidence of downward earnings management is stronger for firms likely to have greater outsourcing activities. These findings are consistent with firms managing accounting information in circumstances where this is likely to benefit allied politicians, thus supporting the idea of a ""political currency"" hypothesis.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

In the last decade, Mexico has undergone a process of internationalization of its banking industry. Today, more than 80 percent of the equity of Mexican banks belongs to internationally active bank corporations. This internationalization demands more transparent regulation, including standardized accounting rules and better disclosure of information. The case of Mexico can therefore serve as an example of the relevance of these changes, as well as of their scope and limitations. This paper attempts to clarify the nature and structure of the new accounting standards, and explains how they have affected financial statements and their interpretation. Key concepts include: Mexican bank accounting standards enjoyed special treatment during most of the 20th century because banking was an industry protected from foreign competition in a relatively closed economy. More transparent bank accounts and stricter accounting processes in Mexico are especially crucial today, in light of the predominantly foreign ownership of the Mexican banking system. The classification of financial operations still varies from country to country. National differences emerge despite the fact that financial instruments, products, and transactions are either very similar or the same worldwide. Legal and regulatory stipulations, accounting history, tax structure, and local business practices create differences in the way financial transactions are recorded in the financial statements.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Crane. Here's his suggestion for bringing regulation into the 21st century. Key concepts include: The Treasury proposal recognizes that fundamental change in the regulatory structure is required for managing risk in the financial system. The difficulty with the approach is that the risk in the financial system will not disappear—it will simply move to the non-prudentially regulated firms. The United States should include all financial service firms under the regulatory authority of the new prudential regulator.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Spending by the Financially Constrained,/item/where-does-it-go-spending-by-the-financially-constrained,10 Apr 2008,"Despite widespread interest by academics, businesspeople, and policymakers, much is unknown about the financial behavior of low-income individuals, particularly those who rarely or ever use banks. Do credit constrained consumers spend money more quickly than less constrained consumers? Do they spend the money in different manners (card-based merchant transactions versus cash ATM withdrawals)? Do credit constrained consumers have different spending patterns than the less constrained—do they buy different goods and services? This working paper provides preliminary data on spending patterns by over 1.5 million refund recipients, all of whom used either a loan or a settlement product to receive refund money faster than the IRS processes would have otherwise allowed. The results should inform the view of policymakers, financial service professionals, scholars, and consumer advocates. Key concepts include: The conclusion that a material fraction of funds was used to pay for necessities suggests that the federal Earned Income Tax Credit program is central to the lives of the poor. Loans tended to be used to obtain necessities, especially funds spent in the first few days of the loans. Consumer advocates who seek to ban settlement products should consider how a ban would affect households' ability to smooth consumption. Similarly, businesses that are pricing and marketing these products should be mindful that the products are not a luxury for the users. These findings document the fairly rapid speed of spending of refunds, which may help policymakers think about the economic stimulus impact of tax refunds and rebates.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
776,Sell Side School Ties,/item/sell-side-school-ties,20 Mar 2008,"Certain agents play key roles in revealing information into securities markets. In the equities market, security analysts are among the most important. A large part of an analyst's job (perhaps the majority) is to research, produce, and disclose reports forecasting aspects of companies' future prospects, and to translate their forecasts into stock recommendations. Therefore, isolating how, or from whom, analysts obtain the information they use to produce their recommendations is important. Do analysts gain comparative information advantages through their social networks—specifically, their educational ties with senior officers and board members of firms that they cover? This paper investigates ties between sell-side analysts and management of public firms, and the subsequent performance of their stock recommendations. Key concepts include: Equity analysts outperform on their stock recommendations when they have an educational link to that company. A simple portfolio strategy of going long the buy recommendations of analysts with school ties and going short the buy recommendations of analysts without ties earns returns of 5.40% per year in the full sample. Informal information networks are an important, yet under-emphasized channel through which private information gets revealed into prices.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
777,Long-Run Stockholder Consumption Risk and Asset Returns,/item/long-run-stockholder-consumption-risk-and-asset-returns,26 Feb 2008,"The long-run consumption risk of households that hold financial assets is particularly relevant for asset pricing. The fact that stockholders are more sensitive to aggregate consumption movements helps explain why the consumption risk of stockholders delivers lower risk aversion estimates. Understanding further why consumption growth, particularly that of stockholders, responds slowly to news in asset returns will improve finance scholars' understanding of what drives these long-run relations. HBS professor Malloy and his coauthors examine more disaggregated measures of long-run consumption risks across stockholders and non-stockholders, and provide new evidence on the long-run properties of consumption growth and its importance for asset pricing. Key concepts include: Small and value stocks earn low returns, and long-term bonds do poorly when the future consumption growth of stockholders is low. The high average returns observed for small and value stocks and long-maturity bonds may therefore reflect the premium stockholders require to bear long-run consumption risk.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
778,Consumer Demand for Prize-Linked Savings: A Preliminary Analysis,/item/consumer-demand-for-prize-linked-savings-a-preliminary-analysis,22 Feb 2008,"Prize-linked savings (PLS) products are savings vehicles that may appeal to people with little savings and little interest in traditional savings products. PLS products offer savers a return in the form of the chance to earn large prizes, rather than in more traditional forms of interest or dividend income or capital appreciation. The probability of winning is typically determined by account balances, and the aggregate prize pool can be set to deliver market returns to all savers. Prize-linked assets are offered in over twenty countries around the world—including the U.K., Sweden, South Africa, and many Latin American and Middle Eastern countries—but are not available in the United States, where state laws and federal regulations make the offering of prize-linked programs problematic. This working paper provides a first look into demand for a PLS product in the United States. Key concepts include: PLS products are promising, despite formidable barriers to success in the United States. The low income population that was studied expressed substantial interest in a savings product that provides prizes as part of its return. This product appeals to non-savers, who do not save with traditional products. The product appeals to heavy lottery players, and by virtue of this fact, has the potential of turning their gambling activities into demand for savings. PLS products might face an uphill battle in the United States due significantly to well-established gambling and lottery industries that might oppose PLS, and the roadblocks due to legal uncertainty and prohibitions around this new product. Businesses or state treasurers might be reluctant to innovate around a product that must compete against heavily marketed alternatives.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
779,Do Legal Origins Have Persistent Effects Over Time? A Look at Law and Finance around the World c. 1900,/item/do-legal-origins-have-persistent-effects-over-time-a-look-at-law-and-finance-around-the-world-c-1900,21 Feb 2008,"A significant number of recent papers find legal origins to be strongly correlated with current indices of rule of law, financial development, the regulation of entry and labor, and the concentration of ownership, among other things. Few studies, however, have explored whether correlations between institutions and economic and financial outcomes hold in the past. For this reason, we cannot be certain that the alleged persistence of the effects of these institutions passes the scrutiny of history. This paper examines specifically the relationship between legal origins and financial development by analyzing countries' legal traditions and the extent of investor protections and financial development over time. Key concepts include: Circa 1910, the protection of shareholders did not rely strongly on government or court enforcement of shareholder rights. In many countries, companies reliant on outside financing had to win investor trust by either building good reputations or writing strong protections for small shareholders into their company bylaws. The findings of this paper do not imply that legal origin cannot be a significant explanatory variable of the differences observed in financial development today. Instead, they suggest a need for more research into how shocks of the 20th century triggered a political process that led to state intervention and regulation, which ended up making legal origin matter more.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
780,The Small World of Investing: Board Connections and Mutual Fund Returns,/item/the-small-world-of-investing-board-connections-and-mutual-fund-returns,12 Feb 2008,"How does information flow in security markets, and how do investors receive information? In the context of information flow, social networks allow a piece of information to flow along a network often in predictable paths. HBS professors Lauren Cohen and Christopher Malloy, along with University of Chicago colleague Andrea Frazzini, studied a type of dissemination through social networks tied to educational institutions, examining the information flow between mutual fund portfolio managers and senior officers of publicly traded companies. They then tested predictions on the portfolio allocations and returns earned by mutual fund managers on securities within and outside their networks. Key concepts include: Social networks are important for information flow between firms and investors. Across the spectrum of U.S. mutual fund portfolio managers, fund managers place larger concentrated bets on stocks they are connected to through their education network, and do significantly better on these holdings relative to non-connected holdings, and relative to connected firms they choose not to hold. A portfolio of connected stocks held by managers outperforms non-connected stocks by up to 8.4 percent per year. This connection is not driven by firm, fund, school, industry, or geographic location effects, nor by a subset of the school connections (e.g., Ivy League). The bulk of this premium occurs around corporate news events such as earnings announcements. This finding suggests that the excess return earned on connected stocks is driven by information flowing through the network. As the information will eventually be revealed into stock prices, advance knowledge implies return predictability.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
781,Attracting Flows by Attracting Big Clients: Conflicts of Interest and Mutual Fund Portfolio Choice,/item/attracting-flows-by-attracting-big-clients-conflicts-of-interest-and-mutual-fund-portfolio-choice,07 Feb 2008,"Retirement assets make up a large and growing percentage of the mutual fund universe. In 2004, nearly 40 percent of all mutual fund assets were held by defined contribution plans and individual retirement accounts. This percentage is steadily increasing largely because these retirement accounts represent the majority of new flows into non-money market mutual funds. With such a large and growing percentage of their assets coming from retirement accounts, mutual funds are likely to be interested in securing these big clients. This paper examines a new channel through which mutual fund families can attract assets: by becoming a 401(k) plan's trustee. HBS professor Lauren Cohen and colleague Breno Schmidt provide evidence consistent with the trustee relationship affecting families' portfolio choice decisions. These portfolio decisions, however, have the potential to be in conflict with the fiduciary responsibility mutual funds have for their investors, and can impose potentially large costs. Key concepts include: Mutual fund families systematically distort their portfolios to attract 401(k) clients, presenting a conflict of interest. Mutual fund families that become trustees significantly overweight 401(k) sponsor firms' stock in their fund families. The trustee family performs a valuable service to the sponsor company by buying or holding its stocks around times of substantial selling of the sponsor firm by all other funds. Increased buying of sponsor firm shares by its trustee can have substantial price impact by propping up the sponsor firm's price. The overweighting can in some cases result in a large cost to the mutual fund investors. One possible remedy is to require the trustee to be independent of the mutual fund providers in the plan. This could greatly reduce the overweighting behavior currently seen by ostensibly ridding the relationship of its embedded, and unneeded, conflict of interest.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

785,Global Currency Hedging,/item/global-currency-hedging,05 Sep 2007,"This article is forthcoming in the Journal of Finance. How much should investors hedge the currency exposure implicit in their international portfolios? Using a long sample of foreign exchange rates, stock returns, and bond returns that spans the period between 1975 and 2005, this paper studies the correlation of currency excess returns with stock returns and bond returns. These correlations suggest the existence of a typology of currencies. First, the euro, the Swiss franc, and a portfolio simultaneously long U.S. dollars and short Canadian dollars are negatively correlated with world equity markets and in this sense are ""safe"" or ""reserve"" currencies. Second, the Japanese yen and the British pound appear to be only mildly correlated with global equity markets. Third, the currencies of commodity producing countries such as Australia and Canada are positively correlated with world equity markets. These results suggest that investors can minimize their equity risk by not hedging their exposure to reserve currencies, and by hedging or overhedging their exposure to all other currencies. The paper shows that such a currency hedging policy dominates other popular hedging policies such as no hedging, full hedging, or partial, uniform hedging across all currencies. All currencies are uncorrelated or only mildly correlated with bonds, suggesting that international bond investors should fully hedge their currency exposures. Key concepts include: It is striking that the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc, and euro are widely used as reserve currencies by central banks, and more generally as stores of value by corporations and individuals around the world. Interestingly, the euro, the Swiss franc, and a long-short position in the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar are negatively correlated with world equity markets. By contrast, other currencies such as the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Japanese yen, and the British pound are either uncorrelated or positively correlated with world stock markets. These patterns imply that international equity investors can minimize their equity risk by taking short positions in the Australian and Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, and British pound, and long positions in the U.S. dollar, euro, and Swiss franc. For U.S. investors, currency exposures of international equity portfolios should be at least fully hedged, and probably overhedged. Exceptions are the euro and Swiss franc, which should be at most partially hedged. Risk management demands for currencies by bond investors are small or zero, regardless of the home country of these investors, and regardless of whether these investors hold only domestic bonds or an international bond portfolio.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Key concepts include: Hedge funds have entered the activist arena. Between 1994 and 2006, the number of public firms targeted for poor performance by hedge funds grew more than 10-fold. Hedge funds generate returns of over 5 percent on announcement of their involvement with a targeted firm.

Are they best equipped to monitor management? While blockholding by large institutional investors—pension funds and mutual fund investment companies—is widespread, there is virtually no evidence that these institutional shareholders are effective monitors of management or that their presence in the capital structure increases firm value. When institutional blockholders make formal demands on management, there is no evidence of their success. This working paper outlines the advantages and limits of hedge funds to manage these tasks. Greenwood and Schor's characterization differs markedly from previous work on investor activism, which tends to attribute high announcement returns to improvements in operational performance. Key concepts include: While recent popular accounts suggest that we are in an era of the ""imperial shareholder,"" the results in this working paper indicate that activism tends to be most successful when there is a high probability of a takeover. Where improvements may take several quarters or even years to realize, the investment horizon of hedge funds makes them unsuitable overseers of management. Firms that would benefit from modest changes in operating policy or governance, or for which a reduction in CEO pay is to be desired, are not likely to hit the radar screen of hedge funds. While hedge funds do occasionally succeed in changing the board, initiating or increasing dividends, repurchasing shares, or cutting executive pay, it is not clear that these changes increase shareholder value relative to getting the target acquired.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
788,3 Steps to Reduce Financial System Risk,/item/3-steps-to-reduce-financial-system-risk,15 Aug 2007,"By using complex derivative products, banks are better able to manage risk. But this ""credit risk transfer"" technology is transferring risk to a new set of investors inexperienced in this arena and posing exposure problems for the international financial system as a whole, argues Harvard Business School professor Mohamed El-Erian. Here's how to fix the problem. Key concepts include: Regulatory authorities must address 2 challenges to contain a new source of systemic risk in international finance: the increasing migration of complex market activities to unqualified supervisory bodies, and the growing threat of politically motivated changes to regulatory regimes. If left unchecked, systemic risk in the international financial system will increase and much of the initial beneficial impact of credit risk transfer technology may be negated. 3 steps can mitigate this new component of systemic risk: greater cooperation among supervisory bodies; encouragement of rating agencies to improve their modeling of derivative products; and inducement of new investors to evaluate the ratings issued by the agencies against improved internal risk management capabilities.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
789,Economic Catastrophe Bonds,/item/economic-catastrophe-bonds,13 Jul 2007,"Pooling economic assets into large portfolios and tranching them into sequential cash-flow claims has become a big business, generating record profits for both the Wall Street originators and the agencies that rate these securities. This paper by business economics doctoral student Jakub Jurek and HBS professors Joshua Coval and Erik Stafford investigates the pricing and risks of instruments created as a result of recent structured finance activities. It demonstrates that senior collateralized debt obligation (CDO) tranches have significantly different systematic risk exposures than their credit rating-matched, single-name counterparts, and should therefore command different risk premia. Key concepts include: Investors in senior CDO tranches are grossly undercompensated for the highly systematic nature of the risks they bear. An investor willing to assume the economic risks inherent in senior CDO tranches can, with equivalent economic exposure, earn roughly 3 times more compensation by writing out-of-the-money put spreads on the market. Credit rating agencies do not provide customers with adequate information for pricing. They are willing to certify senior CDO tranches as ""safe"" when, from an asset pricing perspective, they are quite the opposite.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
790,Contracting in the Self-reporting Economy,/item/contracting-in-the-self-reporting-economy,26 Jun 2007,"Intellectual property can be used by its owner directly, licensed to a third party for a fixed royalty, or licensed to a third party for a variable royalty. The variable royalty arrangement depends on self-reporting by the licensee, which in turn induces demand for auditing by the licensor. This research studies a setting with the following features: a production cost advantage on the part of the outside party that creates gains from licensing; a limited liability constraint that prevents the licensee from owing more royalties than the gross profits of licensing the intellectual property and prevents the licensor from capturing all of the economic surplus via a fixed royalty agreement; and accounting and auditing costs that reduce the benefits of a variable royalty agreement. Key concepts include: The owner of intellectual property will enter into a variable royalty agreement with an outside party if—and only if—the accounting and auditing costs are sufficiently low. With higher cost levels, the owner will use the property directly if the owner can do so profitably. Otherwise, the owner will prefer to license the property in exchange for a fixed royalty. The expected aggregate accounting system and audit costs are minimized when the licensor can compel the licensee to bear the audit costs in case underreporting is detected. Internal control provisions within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act make variable royalty arrangements based on self-reporting and auditing relatively more attractive than such arrangements prior to Sarbanes-Oxley. Sarbanes-Oxley effectively lowers the licensor's audit costs even though the licensor must audit all low reports, because auditing all low reports deters the licensee from underreporting in the first place.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Professor Josh Lerner looks to history to underscore why this move carries the prospect of damaging what is actually an incredibly competitive industry that creates much value. Key concepts include: The Justice Department, which has little understanding of the nuances of the private equity business, could repeat missteps of the past by mistaking competition for collusion. Deal sharing, in the crosshairs of the inquiry, actually helps investors make better investment decisions, helps companies' managements, and helps limit risk. The benefits to society from widespread venture syndication appear to substantially outweigh the costs. Washington must understand that the many benefits private equity provides by facilitating economic growth are unlikely to be sustained if the heavy hand of government intrudes, whether through litigation or regulation.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
793,Inexperienced Investors and Market Bubbles,/item/inexperienced-investors-and-market-bubbles,19 Feb 2007,"The evidence isn't conclusive, but new research from Harvard Business School suggests younger fund managers may have contributed to the tech stock bubble. Professor Robin Greenwood discusses the research paper, ""Inexperienced Investors and Bubbles,"" and what mutual fund investors should keep in mind. Key concepts include: The research supports theories that inexperienced investors are prone to buy assets with inflated prices during times of bubbles. Even professionals are susceptible to trend-chasing. Fund managers under the age of thirty-five were more likely than older managers to overly invest in tech stocks in the last bubble.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

796,Learning from Private-Equity Boards,/item/learning-from-private-equity-boards,17 Jan 2007,"Boards of professionally sponsored buyouts are more informed, hands-on, and interventionist than public company boards. HBS professor emeritus Malcolm S. Salter argues that this board model could have helped Enron—and perhaps your company as well. Key concepts include: Boards compiled by professionally sponsored buyout firms are typically more informed and hands-on, and have more investment at risk than boards of public companies. That makes them more likely to spot problems and intervene before the problems become crises. Public companies need to consider a different population of directors to include the large pool of former executives and successful entrepreneurs who have stepped down after decades of accomplishment and have the time, energy, and interest to be truly focused directors. Given increasing time commitments and responsibilities, public companies need to present a better financial reward for directors—a doubling of director compensation may be an absolute minimum. Directors should be required to invest between $250,000 and $1 million in personal holdings depending on revenue size of the company.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
797,"Banking Deregulation, Financing Constraints and Entrepreneurship",/item/banking-deregulation-financing-constraints-and-entrepreneurship,03 Jan 2007,"What effect does an increase in banking competition have on the entry of start-ups? In particular, does an increase in banking competition have a differential effect on the entry of start-ups relative to the opening of new establishments by existing firms? The U.S. branch banking deregulations provide a useful laboratory for studying how banking competition affects small businesses. Prior to 1970, all but twelve states had stringent restrictions on the ability of banks to open new branches or to acquire the branches of other banks within the state; beginning in the 1970s and until 1994, all but two states removed these restrictions. In this research, Kerr and Nanda studied the entry of newly incorporated businesses between 1976 and 1999 using detailed data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. Their findings matter for understanding how reforms that affect the financing environment may improve the real economy through the reallocation of resources in the non-financial sectors. Key concepts include: Interstate branch banking deregulations had a positive effect on both the entry rates and entry sizes of start-ups relative to the facility expansions of existing firms. These beneficial effects were evident in multiple sectors of the economy and stronger in more financially dependent industries. While greater banking competition may hurt entrepreneurs through a decline in relationship banking or loan subsidization, the positive net effects point to substantial increases in credit provision to start-ups. The impact of financial market reforms on product market entry is an important micro-foundation for understanding and fostering economic growth.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
798,What’s Behind the Private Equity Boom?,/item/whats-behind-the-private-equity-boom,22 Dec 2006,"Podcast: On just one day in November, $52 billion worth of private equity deals were announced, and more than $200 billion worth of deals have been agreed to so far in 2006. The deals include such major names as Qantas ($8.7 billion), Hertz ($15 billion), and Clear Channel ($ 18.7 billion). Are public markets being eclipsed? Are investors and employees being victimized? Professor Josh Lerner looks at historical trends and current deals to put it all in perspective. Key concepts include: An influx of money on the equity side from pension funds and overseas investors is helping create an explosion of LBOs. Hedge funds have joined banks as major providers of debt, creating a market with more favorable terms for investors. Although there have been deals that have gone sour, the private equity boom can be seen as mostly beneficial for both investors and the companies involved.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
799,The Money Connection—Understanding VC Networks,/item/the-money-connectionunderstanding-vc-networks,04 Dec 2006,"Venture capital firms often consider investments in companies located far away or in unfamiliar industries. How do they spot these opportunities and also reduce risk? It's the power of networks, says Harvard Business School professor Toby Stuart—and understanding how they work in VC is just now starting to be understood. Key concepts include: Networks are important in all industries, but especially so in VC where investment opportunities can be located far away from the centers of venture capital. ""Spanning ties"" enable investors with fixed locations and industry expertise to learn of opportunities outside their geographic and industry domains, while also reducing risk. Ties are more likely to form between VC firms in the context of bandwagons, such as a ""hot"" IPO market, that create a rush of excitement around particular types of companies.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Few can have both. Professor Noam Wasserman discusses his research into the motivations of entrepreneurs and the people who invest in them. Key concepts include: Entrepreneurs are often motivated by the potential of money and control, but very few ever achieve both. A fundamental tension between ""rich and regal"" starts to develop as entrepreneurs look to attract resources to grow their ventures. Investors need to understand the motivations of the entrepreneurs they back to make sure goals are aligned.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Studying almost 500 private equity-led IPOs over a 22-year period, Lerner and co-researcher Jerry Cao conclude that reverse leveraged buyouts in general outperformed other IPOs and the market as a whole. Quick flips, however, are another story. Key concepts include: RLBOs have outperformed other types of IPOs, perhaps because private equity groups prepare their portfolio companies to perform as public companies. RLBOs have performed well across many market cycles. The most successful performances were associated with larger RLBOs, as well as offerings by larger groups. So-called quick flips generally have underperformed the market.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
802,Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing,/item/time-driven-activity-based-costing,05 Jul 2006,"Activity-based costing (ABC) has become popular in business writing and management circles. (An example of an activity would be process customer complaints.) However, calculating baselines for activities, developing the model, and retesting the model once it is implemented is time-consuming and costly. Kaplan and Anderson developed improvements in the process through what they call time-driven ABC. Time-driven ABC decreases the amount of data needed, and only requires estimates of two things: (1) the practical capacity of committed resources and their cost, and (2) unit times for performing transactional activities. Key concepts include: Building an accurate time-based algorithm in one facility will typically serve as a template that can be easily applied and customized to other plants, or even other companies in an industry. Time-driven ABC requires less time and resources to implement. At one company cited, it took two people two days per month to load, calculate, validate, and report findings, compared to the ten-person team spending over three weeks to maintain the previous (traditional ABC) model.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services
803,Float Manipulation and Stock Prices,/item/float-manipulation-and-stock-prices,05 Jul 2006,"When a firm reduces the number of shares available to trade, so-called float manipulation, the price of the stock is often driven up. The author uses a series of 2,000 stock split events in Japan as an experiment to understand the consequences of float manipulation for stock prices. The conclusion: Stock prices are raised significantly when there are differing opinions about the value of shares, investors are unable to sell short, and the number of outstanding shares is reduced. Key concepts include: Firms may use a float reduction as an opportunity to raise equity, or managers may exploit it as an opportunity to sell overpriced shares.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

The ""invariant proportion of substitution,"" or IPS, property comes into play when, for example, a consumer faces a choice among three laptop computers with slightly different attributes. How will improvements to one laptop's attributes affect how the consumer chooses to substitute one alternative for another? Steenburgh looked at probabilities based on assumptions about consumers' utility-maximizing behavior. Key concepts include: The IPS property can be interpreted as an implicit assumption that is made to attain parsimony at the expense of flexibility. Idiosyncratic variation in the consumer's taste parameters can eliminate the IPS restriction.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

The model is tested on 298 Nikkei index stocks and 1,458 non-index stocks for the years 1993 through 2003. The study finds that controlling for index membership, index overweighting is a significant determinant of the comovement of returns with index returns. Key concepts include: Correlated investor demand for securities causes periodic and widespread mispricing. Members of arbitrarily weighted stock indexes, oftentimes ""liquid"" securities, are subject to frequent mispricing.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

The problem: Analysts often operate under incentives that are inconsistent with telling the truth. Retail investors, who tend to be less sophisticated, may fail to make proper adjustments for the more nuanced of the resulting biases, some of which might be reflected in market prices. To study the scope of market efficiency, Scherbina studied analysts' incentives, resulting forecast biases, and their potential impact on market prices. Key concepts include: When the level of analyst disagreement about future earnings is high, the average forecast tends to be overly optimistic. The ""marginal investor,"" on average, fails to interpret analysts' earnings forecasts with an eye to inherent biases. Sophisticated investors have a beneficial effect on market efficiency.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

The author attempts to spark greater academic interest in the legal aspects of management by proposing a systems approach to law and management ""that explains how law affects the competitive environment, the firm's resources, and the activities in the value chain."" Key concepts include: There is a variety of legal tools that managers can use as part of their market strategy to increase realizable value and manage risk.

This research offers new insights into the ongoing debate about how best to educate the business leaders of tomorrow. More than a standalone course in business law or ethics, it would be wise for educators to use an approach that treats the role of law and business in the broader context of societal needs and norms. Key concepts include: Business school curricula that ignore the role law plays in making markets possible may undermine students' appreciation of how law undergirds the capitalist system. Business students need to learn both more ethics and law. Teaching materials should highlight the positive associations or linkages between law, business, and societal welfare. The systems approach to management is one way to link law, business, and ethics to create an integrated mental model.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

Did entrepreneurs in these two countries organize their business networks differently to deal with the different institutional settings? And, how can we compare the impact of the institutional structure of Mexico and Brazil on the networks of entrepreneurial finance and entrepreneurship in general? In this research, Musacchio and Read look at the networks of interlocking boards of directors of major joint stock companies in two large Latin American societies in 1909. Key concepts include: Business networks were more important for entrepreneurs, bankers, and politicians in Mexico, supplanting formal institutions to the great benefit of connected Mexican elite. In Mexico, informal monitoring and enforcement provided by the network compensated for the relatively weak rule of law. The Mexican network successfully substituted for formal institutions because it included many politicians. In Brazil, politicians were uncommon in the network because of the stronger formal institutions. At low levels of development, there is no significant difference in how a country grows, either through strong formal institutions or by substituting networks for some of those institutions.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

In the context of the movie business, Elberse calculated the returns in a study comparing 1,200 casting announcements on trading behavior in a simulated and real stock market setting. In a separate study, she also looked at the stars' impact on expected revenues. Key concepts include: Star participation positively impacts movie revenue. Do not just bet on an A-list star: Combine the right star with the right cast. These interdependencies complicate talent recruitment and compensation decisions. Star participation may not add to firm studios' valuation. If profitability or shareholder value is a key objective, studio executives could alter their talent compensation schemes.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Financial Services

877,From Green Users to Green Voters,/item/from-green-users-to-green-voters,22 Aug 2013,"Does the diffusion of technology affect voting patterns? Technology is usually not aligned with a specific ideology or political party. Indeed, to the extent that technology raises living standards, all parties tend to favor technology diffusion. However, in some cases, voters may associate a political party with a specific technology. Green parties, for example, advocate for the diffusion of green energy technologies and pursue policies that foster the diffusion of green energies. This paper finds a significant effect of photovoltaic (PV) adoption on the increase in the share of votes for Germany's Green Party. In particular, the increase in the diffusion rate of PV systems between 1998 and 2009 led to an increase in the fraction of green votes of 1 percent, which represents 25 percent of the actual increase in the voting rate experienced by the Green Party between 1998 and 2009. Key concepts include: This study uncovered the impact that the diffusion of PV systems has on the votes obtained by Germany's Green Party. Individuals that use green technologies are more likely to become Green Party voters. Approximately a quarter of the increase in the share of votes experienced by the Green Party between 1998 and 2009 is driven by the diffusion of PV systems. In contrast, there were no such effects from the diffusion of industrial PV systems and eolic systems. This contrast confirms the importance of voters' direct involvement with the adoption and/or operation of the technology for this to affect their voting patterns.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

883,“Power from Sunshine”: A Business History of Solar Energy,/item/power-from-sunshine-a-business-history-of-solar-energy,14 Jun 2012,"In each generation, the concept of getting ""power from sunshine"" has attracted entrepreneurial visionaries who encountered a perennial problem: Solar energy was expensive compared to conventional fuels that were not priced to incorporate wider environmental costs. This paper by Geoffrey Jones and Loubna Bouamane provides a business history of solar energy between the nineteenth century and the present day. Its covers early attempts to develop solar energy, the use of passive solar in architecture before World War II, the subsequent growth of the modern photovoltaic (PV) industry, and alternative non-PV technologies such as parabolic collectors. As the authors argue, building viable business models proved crucially dependent on two factors: the prices of alternative conventional fuels and public policy. Key concepts include: The potential of solar power has attracted entrepreneurs for well over a century, but they have all struggled to build commercial businesses. The invention of PV cells in the 1950s, the ""space age electronic marvel,"" transformed the potential of solar energy, but also vastly raised the financing stakes as the new technology was complicated and capital-expensive. Niche markets were found, especially among end-users such as satellites, pocket calculators and roof tops, but the widespread use of solar to generate electricity in large grid systems required government subsidies and other support, especially because the environmental costs of fossil fuels were not included in pricing. Subsidies and feed-in tariffs drove the growth of the solar industry over the last decade, especially in Europe and China, but they also distorted incentives and sometimes encouraged rent-seeking. Regular and unpredictable shifts in government policies, influenced by lobbying and shifts in the price of conventional energy sources, were especially damaging to renewable energy, with shifting Federal and state policies in the United States providing a prime example.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

In addition, most of these companies operate in multiple host countries. What determines their disclosure of business activities and hence transparency? Paul Healy, Venkat Kuppuswamy, and George Serafeim examine three forms of disclosure costs that oil and gas managers could potentially consider. Both the US government and the European Union are currently considering laws that would require oil and gas companies to disclose information about operations in host countries. Key concepts include: Competitive risks are an important factor underlying differences in oil and gas firms' disclosure ratings across the host countries in which they operate. Requiring disclosure of payments to foreign governments is unlikely to increase proprietary costs for oil and gas companies. Mandating disclosures about the performance of oil and gas companies in host countries, however, is likely to increase proprietary costs, particularly risk of expropriations and costs related to product market competition. Companies that are coming from more corrupt home countries tend to be less transparent about their payments to host country governments.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

Geography has mattered to some extent, also: Both in the United States and Denmark, the existence of rural areas not supplied by electricity provided the initial stimulus to entrepreneurs and innovators. Building firm-level capabilities has been essential in an industry which has been both technically difficult and vulnerable to policy shifts. Key concepts include: Firms from Denmark have been unusually prominent throughout the history of the wind energy business. The basis of the competitive Danish industry was laid without support or even encouragement from its government. US-based firms have also been regularly found among the leading wind energy companies. But their relative importance varied considerably over time, has rarely reflected the overall importance of the U.S. market, and has involved a changing cast of actual firms. German and Spanish, and more recently Indian and Chinese firms, have emerged to become amongst the largest turbine manufacturers in the industry. The most striking change over the last decade has been in the competitive landscape. Engineering powerhouses, such as GE and Siemens, and wholly or partly state-owned Chinese firms with low-cost bases, are now prominent actors in this industry.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

Key concepts include: The US response to events in the Middle East and North Africa needs to be guided by three key tenets of effective diplomacy: considering our enemies tomorrow, not just our friends today; identifying what makes these situations different from other, similar situations; and being steered by values that can be clearly and consistently articulated. Although they bring uncertainty and higher oil prices in the short term, these revolutions offer the possibility of enhanced representation that will bring the people in these nations more stability, public goods, and a better and more competitive business environment. In autocratic states, protestors always face the threat of violent retribution. Social media networks helped to allay fears by showing people beforehand that the protests would be huge, thus providing some reassurance that it would be difficult for the regimes to retaliate.

Clean-tech start-ups are often stymied by a ""valley of death""—that precarious stage between researching and developing a product and going to market.

The problem: Energy is a commodity product that can't be differentiated, the sector already exists, and the change needs to happen at enormous scale.

HBS professor Richard Vietor reflects on wind energy and innovations in the renewable energy industry. Key concepts include: The Cape Wind project has sparked controversy in the eastern United States related to regulatory, political, environmental, and social concerns. Wind power is important for the near term, but in the longer term solar and nuclear power may gain ground. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries in its approach to renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, President Obama's stimulus package provides significant incentives and subsidies for green energy projects.

In Mexico, the expropriation is viewed as a patriotic triumph, in which the federal government seized control of the country's most valuable natural resource. In the U.S., the temperate reaction of the Roosevelt Administration is seen as the decisive break with Washington's imperial relationship towards Latin America. Washington ""curbed its finance capital,"" it is said, and downgraded the protection of American overseas private investments. In this paper, HBS professor Noel Maurer explains how the actual historical record diverges substantially from the accepted view. Key concepts include: The oil companies developed political strategies that maneuvered the very reluctant Roosevelt Administration into defending their interests. A detailed understanding of the key players in the executive branch was fundamental to these strategies. The U.S. government succeeded using sanctions and the threat of sanctions to force Mexico to compensate—in fact, overcompensate—American companies. The Mexican oil industry was in decline by the 1930s for geological (not political) reasons. As a result, the American oil companies with interests in Mexico were in financial distress during the same period. The oil companies deliberately provoked the expropriation, because they could not afford to give in to union demands to control all hiring and firing. The expropriation did not increase the Mexican government's petroleum revenues or the wages paid to Mexican oil workers. The key difference between the environment of the 1930s and today is that in the 1930s, domestic courts still refused to use their authority against foreign governments. Today, that is no longer the case.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy
897,Accelerating Innovation In Energy: Insights from Multiple Sectors,/item/accelerating-innovation-in-energy-insights-from-multiple-sectors,24 Feb 2010,"How should the energy sector best respond to the threat of climate change? In this introductory chapter to a forthcoming book, Harvard Business School's Rebecca M. Henderson and Richard G. Newell of Duke University frame the discussion by highlighting the volume's contributions concerning four particularly innovative sectors of the U.S. economy: agriculture, chemicals, life sciences, and information technology. These four sectors have been extraordinarily important in driving recent economic growth. Henderson and Newell describe why accelerating innovation in energy could play an important role in shaping an effective response to climate change. Key concepts include: An effective innovation system has three key elements: accelerating demand for new technology; institutions that support abundant generation and dissemination of fundamental scientific and technical knowledge; and a vibrant, competitive private sector. Public policy has played a role in building and/or sustaining all three elements. If the goal of federal policy is to encourage effective technological solutions to mitigate climate change, then a short-term commitment is unlikely to meet expectations, even if the commitment is extraordinarily intense, such as was seen with the Department of Defense's Manhattan Project. If federal agencies increase investment in energy innovation at the same time that vigorous efforts are made to enhance the demand for carbon-free technology, it is likely that technological innovation could play a decisive role in mitigating some of the key economic and social risks arising from climate change.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

For the past decade, most experts have accepted climate change as a fact, making the issue difficult to ignore—yet many politicians, and the voters who elect them, have done exactly that: ignored the problem. Scientists, policymakers, and others have come up with good ideas to address climate change and other energy issues. Many people seek to identify one cause of climate change, when it is abundantly clear that there are multiple causes. Cognitive, organizational, and political barriers exist that prevent us from addressing energy problems despite clearly identified courses of action. The creation and implementation of wise policy recommendations requires us to anticipate resistance to change and develop strategies that can overcome these barriers. Enacting wise legislation to act in time to solve energy problems requires surmounting cognitive, organizational, and political barriers to change. Key concepts include: The new U.S. presidential administration should identify energy policies that make wise tradeoffs across issues. The administration should communicate that decisions will be made to maximize benefits to society rather than to special-interest groups. The administration should seek energy policies that make sense even if climate change is less of a problem than best current estimates suggest. The administration should identify a series of small changes (nudges) that significantly influence the behaviors of individuals and organizations in a positive direction without infringing on personal liberties. When discounting of the future creates an insurmountable barrier to the implementation of wise policies, consider implementation on a mild delay.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy
903,Economics of the Ethanol Business,/item/economics-of-the-ethanol-business,03 Nov 2008,"What happens when a group of Missouri corn farmers gets into the energy business? What appears to be a very lucrative decision quickly turns out to be much more risky. Professor Forest Reinhardt leads a case discussion on what the protagonists should do next. From HBS Alumni Bulletin. Key concepts include: The case examines the complex political and economic underpinnings of the ethanol industry. By investing in corn-based ethanol, farmers reduce their exposure to corn prices, but at the expense of exposure to the oil market. The case promotes greater understanding of the way materials and energy flow in the modern U.S. agricultural system.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

Can it be measured? A Q&A with Harvard Business School professor Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and case writer Jordan Mitchell. Key concepts include: The challenge for a business student is how to put a quantifiable measure on whether Greenpeace and WWF are successful in reaching goals. WWF and Greenpeace create value by increasing the world's willingness-to-pay on environmental issues. Most scientists agree that the earth is deteriorating at a faster rate than during the 1960s and 1970s, but it would be worse off had it not been for the tireless campaigning of environmental NGOs.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy
905,Innovation Corrupted: How Managers Can Avoid Another Enron,/item/innovation-corrupted-how-managers-can-avoid-another-enron,07 Jul 2008,"The train wreck that was Enron provides key insights for improving corporate governance and financial incentives as well as organizational processes that strengthen ethical discipline, says HBS professor emeritus Malcolm S. Salter. His new book, Innovation Corrupted: The Origins and Legacy of Enron's Collapse, is a deep reflection on the present and future of business. Key concepts include: Enron's stated purpose was too general to permit disciplined and responsible decision-making in the face of difficulty. The lessons of Enron relate to strengthening board oversight, avoiding perverse financial incentives for executives, and instilling ethical discipline throughout business organizations. Directors of public companies can adapt key aspects of the private-equity governance model to ensure that they fulfill their oversight responsibilities. Incentive systems should reward accomplishments other than economic performance, and penalize failures. Companies can take steps to help senior executives avoid the two sources of leadership failure at Enron: personal opportunism and flights to utopianism.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy
906,A Resource Belief-Curse: Oil and Individualism,/item/a-resource-belief-curse-oil-and-individualism,09 Jan 2008,"Capitalism is not as widespread as economists would hope. Data from surveys of public opinion, as well as on the distribution of political parties, confirm the idea that capitalism doesn't flow to poor countries. In some countries, anti-market sentiment has increased in recent years, a period where the price of oil and other primary commodities have soared. This combination of anti-market sentiment and high oil prices has led to renegotiations of oil contracts and even nationalizations in some countries such as Bolivia and Venezuela. It is tempting for economists trained in the theory of political capture to argue that this is just another instance where special interests exploit the circumstances to make an extra dollar. Given that these nationalizations are often popular with the majority of voters, however, the researchers resist this temptation and ask if there are explanations where a positive correlation emerges between voter anti-market sentiment and dependence on oil. Key concepts include: Antipathy toward markets has become particularly acute in Latin America. In Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Argentina, policymakers have focused their anti-market energies and attention on natural resource companies, in several cases even renegotiating their contracts. A connection between dependence on oil and receptivity to populist rhetoric is both natural in economic models and has some support in the data.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

How should firms respond? A case study exploring how financial service giant UBS thinks through the issues has students coming down on different sides. Key concepts include: Firms are increasingly called upon to respond to public concerns and actions by competitors on the issue of climate change. 'Green' responses that are simple profit maximization won't impress activist organizations looking to reward exemplars. Companies who take leadership roles in the environmental arena also open themselves up as critical targets should something go wrong. In responding to requests from organizations, general managers should think strategically about how, if they get the decision right, the company can serve society while also improving the bottom line.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

Miller, Vincent Dessain, and Daniela Beyersdorfer explain where IR is going, with energy giants BP and Total leading the way. Key concepts include: Good news for stockholders can be bad news for other stakeholders. IR should be consistent and proactive on all fronts. Investors increasingly care about geopolitics, the environment, and social responsibility; financial communication will need to factor this in. Develop IR in a way consistent with your firm's unique operating position. Outside information is important, but the extent to which it should influence a firm's decision-making is an open question.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

911,Risky Business? Protecting Foreign Investments,/item/risky-business-protecting-foreign-investments,05 Mar 2007,"After a string of forced nationalizations of private enterprises in the 1960s and 1970s, the pendulum swung back and companies were again encouraged by host countries to build and run major infrastructure projects such as power and water. But a set of new property protections has done little to manage the risk in many of these politically unstable environments. Professor Louis T. Wells, coauthor of a new book on making foreign investment safe, discusses the current landscape. Key concepts include: Although property rights protections for investors in developing nations have improved since 1980, the new instruments are failing to satisfy the interests of either host countries or their business partners. Protections can be improved by developing a real consensus on the part of investors' home countries, host countries, and investors themselves. Business managers must take a significant role in pushing for a multilateral agreement on foreign direct investment, or at least become active in promoting lesser changes that will lead to more balance and security in the current system. Otherwise businesses will lose profitable opportunities and find themselves in the middle of disputes that hurt their future prospects. And poor countries will fail to benefit from what investors can bring them. Absent strong protections, managers must ask themselves a series of questions before investing in developing countries, such as: Is my investment project politically sensitive? If so, will the country continue to need my participation in the project?Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy
912,"Manly Men, Oil Platforms, and Breaking Stereotypes",/item/manly-men-oil-platforms-and-breaking-stereotypes,27 Nov 2006,"Men who work in dangerous places often act invulnerable to prove their merit as workers and as men—objectives that can lead to decreased safety and efficiency. Professor Robin Ely and her team helicoptered to offshore oil platforms in order to understand ""manly men"" and how working environments can be changed to alter men's enactments of manhood. Key concepts include: Men's masculine identity (like women's feminine identity) is a profoundly social and cultural phenomenon. In dangerous, male-dominated work settings, men's tendency to gain respect by demonstrating and defending their masculinity is costly. Efforts to appear invulnerable block precisely the kinds of actions that encourage safety and effectiveness. Offshore oil platforms, although male dominated, are also improving safety dramatically. Rather than seeking to prove how tough, proficient, and cool-headed they are, platform workers purposefully make themselves vulnerable in order to perform their jobs more safely and effectively.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Energy

1000,How Should We Pay for Health Care?,/item/how-should-we-pay-for-health-care,27 Dec 2014,"Improving provider incentives and reimbursement must become a central component in health care reform. Payments need to align with the value delivered to patients: better health outcomes delivered at lower costs. Today, however, deeply‐flawed reimbursement approaches actively discourage providers from delivering value to their patients. In this paper the authors argue that reimbursement through bundled payments is the only approach that aligns providers, payers, and suppliers in a healthy competition to increase patient value. The authors describe the principles of value‐based bundled payments, how such bundles should be constructed, and why they believe this reimbursement method best aligns everyone's interests around value. They show how recent improvements in measuring patient's outcomes and the cost of care are overcoming the past barriers to wider adoption of bundled payments. They conclude by describing how bundled payments can transform competition in health care, and the longer‐term implications for providers, payers, employers, and health care delivery systems. Key concepts include: A value‐based bundled payment is a single payment for treating a patient with a specific medical condition across a full cycle of care. A bundled payment should cover all the procedures, tests, drugs, devices, and services during inpatient, outpatient, and rehabilitative care for a patient's medical condition. The limited adoption of value‐based bundles to date has been caused by today's fragmented structure for delivering healthcare, and inadequate or non‐existent measurement of costs and outcomes at the medical‐condition level. Recent advances in value‐based healthcare delivery concepts set the stage for much more widespread adoption of value-based bundled payments.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

In this paper, the authors investigate queue management, a key operational decision, in the setting of a hospital emergency department. Specifically, they explore the impact on throughput time depending on whether an emergency department uses a pooled queuing system (in which a physician is assigned to a patient once the patient is placed in an emergency department bed) or a dedicated queuing system (in which physicians are assigned to specific patients at the point of triage). The authors measured throughput time based on individual patients' length of stay in the emergency department, starting with arrival to the emergency department and ending with a bed request for admission to the hospital or the discharge of a patient to home or to an outside facility. The findings show that, on average, the use of a dedicated queuing system decreased patients' lengths of stay by 10 percent. This represented a 32-minute reduction in length of stay—a meaningful time-savings for the emergency department and patients alike. The authors argue that physicians in the dedicated queuing system had both the incentive and ability to make sure their patients' care progressed efficiently, so that patients in the waiting room could be treated sooner than they otherwise would have. Key concepts include: This study tests the impact of a queuing system structure on the throughput time of patients in an emergency department that had recently switched from a pooled queuing system to a dedicated queuing system. Patients experienced faster throughput times when physicians were working in a dedicated queuing system as opposed to a pooled queuing system. The benefits of a dedicated queuing system may be due to greater visibility into one's workload and the increased ability for physicians to manage patient flow.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

Specifically, the study finds that reducing the time it takes to order an ultrasound counter intuitively increases patient throughput time as a result of increased ultrasound use without a corresponding increase in quality of care. Furthermore, the authors show that in the complex, interconnected system or hospitals, changes in resource capacity affects not only the patients who receive the additional resources, but also other patients who share the resource, in this case, radiology. These results highlight how demand can be influenced by capacity due to behavioral responses to changes in resource availability, and that this change in demand has far reaching effects on multiple types of patients. Interestingly, the increased ultrasound ordering capacity was achieved by removing what appeared to be a ""wasteful"" step in the process. However, the results suggest that the step may not have been wasteful as it reduced inefficient ultrasound orders. In healthcare, these results are very important as they provide an explanation for some of the ever-increasing costs: reducing congestion through increased capacity results in even more congestion due to higher resource use. Overall, the study suggests an operations-based solution of increasing the cost/difficulty of ordering discretionary but sometimes low-efficacy treatments to address the rise in healthcare spending. Therefore, to improve hospital performance it could be optimal to put into place ""inefficiencies"" to become more efficient. Key concepts include: A process improvement can inadvertently cause an increase in demand for a service as well as associated shared resources, which results in congestion, counter intuitively decreasing overall system performance. While individual patients and physicians may benefit from the reduced processing time, there can be unintended consequences for overall system performance.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health
1014,Organizational Factors that Contribute to Operational Failures in Hospitals,/item/organizational-factors-that-contribute-to-operational-failures-in-hospitals,01 Oct 2013,"Despite a pressing need to do so, hospitals are struggling to improve efficiency, quality of care, and patient experience. Operational failures—defined as instances where an employee does not have the supplies, equipment, information, or people needed to complete work tasks—contribute to hospitals' poor performance. Such failures waste at least 10 percent of caregivers' time, delay care, and contribute to safety lapses. This paper seeks to increase hospital productivity and quality of care by uncovering organizational factors associated with operational failures so that hospitals can reduce the frequency with which these failures occur. The authors, together with a team of 25 people, conducted direct observations of nurses on the medical/surgical wards of two hospitals, which surfaced 120 operational failures. The team also shadowed employees from the support departments that provided materials, medications, and equipment needed for patient care, tracing the flow of materials through the organizations' internal supply chains. This approach made it possible to discover organizational factors associated with the occurrence and persistence of operational failures. Overall, the study develops propositions that low levels of internal integration among upstream supply departments contributed to operational failures experienced by downstream frontline staff, thus negatively impacting performance outcomes, such as quality, timeliness, and efficiency. Key concepts include: To avoid workarounds or the need to keep large stocks of materials on the units, managers should create a method for customer-facing employees to request and receive patient-specific supplies in a timely fashion. Employees are unlikely to discern the role that their department's routines play in operational failures, which hinders solution efforts. Failures and causes may be dispersed over a wide range of factors. Thus, removing failures will require deliberate cross-functional efforts to redesign workspaces and processes so they are better integrated with patients' needs.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health
1015,The Impact of Conformance and Experiential Quality on Healthcare Cost and Clinical Performance,/item/the-impact-of-conformance-and-experiential-quality-on-healthcare-cost-and-clinical-performance,27 Sep 2013,"This study examines the relationship between hospital's focus on both conformance and experiential dimensions of quality and their impact on financial and clinical outcomes. Conformance quality measures the level of adherence to evidence-based standards of care achieved by the hospitals. Experiential quality, on the other hand, measures the extent to which caregivers consider the specific needs of the patient in care and communication, as perceived by the patient. These are important dimensions to investigate because hospitals may face a tension between improving clinical outcomes and maintaining their financial bottom-line. However, little has been known on the joint impact of these dimensions on hospital performance in terms of cost and clinical quality. The authors' study, which examined data from multiple sources for the 3,458 U.S. acute care hospitals, is a first step towards understanding these relationships. Results show that hospitals with high levels of combined quality are typically associated with higher costs, but better clinical outcomes, as measured by length of stay and readmissions. These results suggest that hospitals face a tradeoff between cost performance and clinical outcomes. The study also finds that the effect of conformance quality on length of stay is dependent on the level of experiential quality. Taken together, these findings underline the important synergy that exists between conformance and experiential quality with regards to clinical outcomes, a topic that has been completely overlooked in the extant literature. Key concepts include: Hospitals with high levels of combined quality are typically associated with higher costs, but better clinical outcomes, as measured by length of stay and readmissions. Integrating experiential quality into the delivery of care requires caregivers to understand that conformance quality is important, but just one part of achieving excellent clinical outcomes. Experiential quality requires ensuring that patients have a voice in their own care. This might trigger cultural resistance given the inherent bias towards conformance quality. The need for hospitals to promote such radically new representation, despite its clear health benefits, implies an inevitable cost-quality tradeoff. However, this tradeoff might diminish over time, as the culture slowly shifts and caregivers learn to better integrate both process quality dimensions in a more supportive environment. This study addresses a missing gap on the benefit for a systemic approach to learning in care delivery.hClosed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

Pooling—an operations management technique—has been proposed as a way to improve performance by reducing the negative impact of variability in demand for services. The idea is that pooling enables incoming work to be processed by any one of a bank of servers, which deceases the odds that an incoming unit of work will have to wait. Does pooling have a downside? The authors analyze data from a hospital's emergency department over four years. Findings show that, counter to what queuing theory would predict, pooling may actually increase procesdsing times in discretionary work settings. More specifically, patients have longer lengths of stay when emergency department physicians work in systems with pooled tasks and resources versus dedicated ones. Overall, the study suggests that managers of discretionary work systems should design control mechanisms to mitigate behaviors that benefit the employee to the detriment of customers or the organization. One mechanism is to make the workload constant regardless of work pace, which removes the benefit of slowing down. Key concepts include: This research offers practical insights for workplace managers and health care policymakers. In workplaces where workers have discretionary control, the potential negative effects of designing pooled systems must be carefully considered. This has implications for designing and managing staffing structures and workflows, particularly in the context of service delivery organizations. Managers should consider implementing group incentives rather than individual incentives to motivate workers. This may encourage fast workers to reduce their speed just enough so that they will not negatively affect the productivity of others by over-utilizing shared resources. While workplaces often seek to incentivize workers through pay-for-performance programs that focus on individual productivity, a group-level approach may help counteract the negative effects that fast workers exhibit on overall productivity levels. In health care, emergency departments may benefit from implementing non-pooled work systems in which patients are assigned to a doctor-nurse team immediately upon arrival.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

Hospitals are useful settings because they have varying levels of workload. In addition, these settings have high worker autonomy, which enables workers to more easily adjust their processing times in response to workload. Findings show that heavy load plays a significant role in processing times. Congestion is associated with longer lengths of stay. More surprisingly, when there is a high load of incoming patients from a low pressure area (emergency medical patients), current hospital inpatients' stays are longer compared to when incoming patients are from a high pressure area (emergency surgical patients). Furthermore, high predictability of the incoming patients (e.g. scheduled surgical patients) is associated with shorter lengths of stays for the current inpatients than when the incoming patients are less predictable (emergency surgical patients). In this study, there was no decrease in quality of care for patients with shorter lengths of stay. Key concepts include: High congestion increases patients' length of stay by up to 0.81 days, which indicates inefficiency due to overloading of resources. Incoming inventory load with high predictability reduces patients' length of stay by up to 0.45 days, which is enabled by the ability of a worker to plan in advance for a new work assignment by discharging a patient to make room for the incoming one. With highly predictable incoming patients and no congestion on the day before expected discharge, there is a shift toward discharging patients currently in the hospital one day earlier than expected. A hospital would benefit from adding or allocating additional resources to the inpatient hospital units, and counter-intuitively, targeting a lower occupancy level to increase productivity. To further improve productivity, the allocated inpatient hospital resources could include adding a nurse on the hospital floors who is solely responsible for discharges and admissions.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health
1020,The Novelty Paradox & Bias for Normal Science: Evidence from Randomized Medical Grant Proposal Evaluations,/item/the-novelty-paradox-bias-for-normal-science-evidence-from-randomized-medical-grant-proposal-evaluations,10 Jan 2013,"A key task for executives and managers involved with innovation is to evaluate new ideas and proposals. In the sciences, one longstanding hypothesis contends that research ideas outside the mainstream are susceptible to being discounted, rejected, or ignored. These days, expert peer review in academic science is the approach most relied upon for enabling research agendas and providing research funds. Are novel research projects—those deviating from existing research paradigms—treated with a negative bias in expert evaluations? In this paper, the authors investigate how nascent scientific hypotheses are evaluated, specifically looking at the process by which medical research grant proposals are assessed by ""gatekeepers"": in this case, elite researchers from a leading medical school. Innovation requires novelty—but novelty, as this paper shows, is not appreciated and is in fact penalized. These findings help explain concerns about incrementalism in science and also point at the challenge that most organizations face when dealing with novel topics Key concepts include: Expert peer review of new research proposals in academic science is now a large organized practice in its own right. There are many concerns about the reliability of the peer review process. Novel research proposals are generally discounted—even when accounting for quality and feasibility of ideas. Evaluators also tend to be more critical of proposals that were closer to their area of expertise-and these two effects of novelty and intellectual distance appear to work largely independently of one another. How novel ideas and research hypotheses are treated may be consequential to the organization of innovation in general and peer evaluation in the sciences in particular.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

1022,Colocation and Scientific Collaboration: Evidence from a Field Experiment,/item/colocation-and-scientific-collaboration-evidence-from-a-field-experiment,25 Sep 2012,"In recent years there has been considerable interest in the policy arena on fostering collaborative and especially interdisciplinary collaborations. Yet there is scant evidence on how to do this in practice. To learn how team members find each other in the scientific community and decide to collaborate, the authors designed and carried out an experiment involving Harvard University and its affiliated hospitals. Results suggest that matching between scientists may be subject to considerable frictions, even among scientists in relatively close geographic proximity and in the same organizational system. However, even a brief and focused event facilitating face-to-face interactions can be useful for the formation of new scientific collaborations. Key concepts include: Face-to-face interactions play a central role in the initiation of new collaborations. Creating settings where scientists meet face to face and discuss early-stage research ideas can be useful for fostering collaboration. Matching between scientists is not easy. For example, many factors that affect successful collaboration are not easily observed to both parties until collaboration is well underway, such as personal chemistry and scheduling constraints. Time spent in events that facilitate face-to-face interactions also has opportunity costs. The effect of such activities on scientific productivity and welfare more generally is still unclear. This is the first study to bring field experimental methods to a workplace setting in the scientific community.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

1025,Key Drivers of Successful Implementation of an Employee Suggestion-Driven Improvement Program,/item/key-drivers-of-successful-implementation-of-an-employee-suggestion-driven-improvement-program,22 Aug 2012,"Service organizations frequently implement improvement programs to increase quality. These programs often rely on employees' suggestions about improvement opportunities. Yet organizations face a trade-off with suggestion-driven improvement programs. Should managers use an ""analysis-oriented"" approach to surface a large number of problems, prioritize these, and select a small set of high priority ones for solution efforts? Or is it better to take an ""action-oriented"" approach, addressing problems raised by frontline staff regardless of priority ranking? In this paper the authors weigh the tradeoff between these two different approaches. Using data from 58 work groups in 20 hospitals that implemented an 18-month-long employee suggestion-driven improvement program, the authors find that an action-oriented approach was associated with higher perceived improvement in performance, while an analysis-oriented approach was not. The study suggests that the analysis-oriented approach negatively impacted employees' perceptions of improvement because it solicited, but not act on, employees' ideas. Key concepts include: There is a tradeoff because organizations must make allocation decisions between resolving a smaller number of higher priority problems and resolving a larger number of lower priority problems. In this study, an action-oriented approach was manifested by a higher percentage of solved problems that were considered ""easy"" to solve, which enabled more problems to be addressed with the same set of human and organizational resources. In contrast, the analysis-oriented approach, as characterized by identifying and solving higher priority problems, was not associated with higher perceived improvement in performance. Organizations should focus on increasing their capacity to act on improvement suggestions rather than generating suggestions and prioritizing them. Improvement programs are more likely to change employees' perceptions when they result in action being taken to resolve problems rather than when they are a symbolic show of manager interest.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health
1026,A Randomized Field Study of a Leadership WalkRounds™-Based Intervention,/item/a-randomized-field-study-of-a-leadership-walkrounds-based-intervention,22 Aug 2012,"Hospitals face an imperative to improve quality, increase efficiency, and improve customer experience. Many hospitals utilize process improvement techniques to achieve these goals. One technique to involve senior managers, known in hospitals most commonly as Leadership WalkRounds , is a program of visiting the organization's frontlines to observe and talk with employees while they do their work. The intention is that managers and frontline staff will work together to identify and resolve obstacles to efficiency, quality, or safety. (For brevity, the authors refer to it in this paper as WalkRounds .) Rigorous testing of the effectiveness of process improvement interventions generally, and WalkRounds particularly, however, has been rare. This paper presents results from a field study that tested the effectiveness of a safety improvement program inspired by WalkRounds . The authors compare pre-program and post-program measures of perceived improvement in performance (PIP) from work areas in hospitals that were randomly selected to implement the program, with pre- and post- measures from the same types of work areas in control hospitals. Findings show that, contrary to expectations, the WalkRounds -based program was associated with decreased PIP. This study calls into question the general effectiveness of WalkRounds on employees' perceptions, which had been assumed in prior literature. Key concepts include: This study shows that participating in this particular program actually decreased perceived improvement in performance (PIP), on average. Compared to control work areas, the WalkRounds -based program was associated with a statistically significant decrease in PIP. This is an important result because, despite the limited evidence base, many hospitals throughout the U.S. and U.K. have implemented similar programs under the assumption that WalkRounds will improve organizational climate. The study provides a cautionary tale that visits by senior managers to the frontlines of the organization will not necessarily increase staff perceptions of performance improvement. Failure to meet expectations, once raised, can negatively impact organizational climate. Unless such programs are implemented with authentic motivation to identify and resolve issues, they may yield a negative return on the money invested.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health
1027,The Need for (Long) Chains in Kidney Exchange,/item/the-need-for-long-chains-in-kidney-exchange,09 Aug 2012,"It is illegal in the U.S. and in most of the world to buy or sell organs for transplantation. Kidney exchange arises because a healthy person has two kidneys and can donate one to a person in need of a transplant. But a donor and his or her intended recipient may be incompatible. An incompatible patient-donor pair can exchange with another pair, or with more than one other pair, in a cycle of exchanges among patient-donor pairs that allows each patient to receive a kidney from a compatible donor. In addition, sometimes exchange can be initiated by an altruistic donor who does not designate a particular intended patient, and in that case a chain of exchanges need not form a closed cycle. This paper seeks to understand why such longer chains have become increasingly important in practical kidney exchange. The answer has to do with the growing percentage of patients for whom finding a compatible donor is difficult. These ""highly sensitized"" patients are those for whom finding a transplantable kidney is difficult, even from a donor with the same blood type, because of tissue-type incompatibilities. This paper shows that highly sensitized patients are the ones to benefit from longer cycles and chains, and that this does not harm low-sensitized patients. Key concepts include: As long as there is such a high percentage of highly sensitized patients, long chains will help by increasing the number of these patients who can receive transplants, and each altruistic donor can have a big effect.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

In organizations as work grows increasingly fragmented—more specialized and divided into smaller tasks—the role of individuals in organizational learning becomes more important. This paper examines how individuals learn directly from their own past experience, and indirectly from the past experience of others. Focusing on one particular performance outcome, the quality of surgeries, findings indicate that individuals learn the most from their own successes and the failures of others, possibly because in both cases they attribute the outcomes to internal rather than external factors. This research has implications for healthcare and organizations more generally. Research by KC Diwas, Bradley R. Staats, and Francesca Gino. Key concepts include: Individuals learn more from their own success than from their own failure or from the success of others. The failure of others has a greater learning effect on individual performance than does others' successful experience. Certain types of experience help to make individuals more open to learning from their own failures. Individuals may be more open to reflect on their own failures and learn from them when they have greater experience with success. Seeing failures in others makes failure not only more acceptable, but it also makes one's own failure less threatening to one's own identity. In addition, the failure of others provides valuable knowledge that can be used for ongoing problem solving. Organizations may need to find other ways to make their members feel capable and interpret failures in ways that do not threaten their self-image.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

Business researchers at Harvard and MIT are rethinking how kidney transplants are allocated to give patients longer lives. An interview with professor Nikolaos Trichakis. Key concepts include: A new empirical model for allocating available kidneys to patients provides the potential for a system with greater fairness and longer life outcomes for those who receive transplants. The method—the work of Nikolaos Trichakis of Harvard Business School and Dimitris Bertsimas and Vivek F. Farias, both of MIT's Sloan School—can help policy designers create the most equitable point system based on their chosen constraints and criteria. In early simulations, the model suggests that life-year expectancies for the program can be increased by up to 8 percent, depending on variables plugged into the process.Closed for comment; 16 Comment(s) posted.",Health

Allocation policies for kidneys from deceased donors are thus of central importance and have to accomplish major objectives in alleviating human suffering, prolonging life, and providing nondiscriminatory, fair, and equal access to organs for all patients. In this paper, the authors focused on national allocation policies in the United States and the recent effort to revise the current policy. Their design of a national allocation policy focuses on perhaps the simplest, most common and currently used priority method, namely a point system. They also present four case studies in which they designed new policies under different scenarios. Key concepts include: This is a novel method for designing allocation policies based on point systems in a systematic, data-driven way. The method offers flexibility to policymakers to select the fairness constraints desired, as well as the prioritization criteria on which the point system will be based. Critically, this method achieves an 8 percent increase in anticipated extra life-year gains, as demonstrated by numerical simulations, which are based on the statistical and simulation tools currently in use by US policymakers.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health
1032,US Healthcare Reform and the Pharmaceutical Industry,/item/us-healthcare-reform-and-the-pharmaceutical-industry,11 Oct 2011,"The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will restructure the US health care market in the coming years. For the pharmaceutical industry, the ACA is likely to prove a mixed blessing. In this paper, Assistant Professor Arthur Daemmrich analyzes the political economy of health care, specifically concerning health care reform. He then considers how the ACA will affect the pharmaceutical sector, both quantitatively in terms of the size of the prescription drug market and qualitatively in terms of industry structure and competitive dynamics. Daemmrich also places the current reforms into historical context and describes the political negotiations that enabled passage of the ACA. Key concepts include: Since the United States is the world's largest prescription drug market and has among the fewest price control mechanisms, the ACA holds significance to pharmaceutical firms internationally. Over the course of its implementation in coming years, the ACA will significantly expand prescription drug use, including at the relative expense of other health services. In 2015, Daemmrich projects pharmaceutical spending between $435 and $440 billion (12.5 percent of total health care spending) and in 2020 it will near $700 billion (14 percent of total health care spending). Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services will be hard pressed to explain increased drug spending to consumers, especially compared to Europe and Japan where reference pricing (capping prices at an average within a therapeutic category or among peer countries) has become the norm. The ACA nevertheless holds the potential for the United States to be the first country to break out of the silo framework that dominates health budgeting in countries using reference price systems and to instead set budgets at the disease (or patient) level, linked to health outcomes.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health
1033,Measuring Teamwork in Health Care Settings: A Review of Survey Instruments,/item/measuring-teamwork-in-health-care-settings-a-review-of-survey-instruments,22 Sep 2011,"It is critical to accurately assess teamwork in health-care organizations. About 60 percent of primary-care practices in the United States use team-based models to coordinate work across the broad spectrum of health professionals needed to deliver quality care; in many other countries the percentage is almost 100 percent. While the benefits of effective teamwork are substantial, effective teamwork is often lacking in these settings, with negative consequences for patients. To date, little has been known about the survey instruments available to measure teamwork. In this paper Valentine, Nembhard, and Edmondson report the results of their systematic review of survey instruments that have been used to measure teamwork in various contexts. Their research helps to identify existing teamwork scales that may be most useful in testing theoretical models. Key concepts include: Researchers often develop a new scale for their project rather than adapt existing scales. It would be better to utilize existing, psychometrically valid scales when possible so that cumulative knowledge of teamwork can be built. Many scales have been developed to assess teamwork. However, only eight scales satisfy the standard psychometric criteria the authors identified, and only three of those have been significantly associated with non-self-reported outcomes. Future research needs to clarify the concept of teamwork. Currently, the variation in ways of conceptualizing teamwork even within the scales that do show relationships to outcomes of interest makes it difficult to know what dimensions are core versus peripheral to the concept. The criteria set forth in this article should be considered standard research practice, and as such the scales that the authors identified are worthy of attention.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

One central issue, for example, is how individual hospitals can be motivated to participate. This paper by Itai Ashlagi (Sloan School of Management, MIT) and Alvin E. Roth (Harvard Business School) provides a theoretical framework to study and overcome the kinds of problems that can be anticipated. Key concepts include: The paper addresses the growing problem of providing hospitals with incentives to participate fully in a national kidney exchange, in order to achieve the gains that exchange on a large scale makes possible. Hospitals might be reluctant to enter a national exchange if it means they would have to give up kidneys to other institutions that could be used in their own patients. In large markets it is possible to redesign the matching mechanisms to guarantee individually rational allocations to hospitals at very modest cost in terms of ""lost transplants."" If care is taken in how kidney exchange mechanisms are organized, the problems of participation may be less troubling in large exchange programs than they are starting to be in multi-hospital exchanges as presently organized.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

This question is particularly urgent in the US health- care industry, where problems occur often and consequences range from minor inconveniences to serious patient harm. In this paper, HBS doctoral student Julia Adler-Milstein, Harvard School of Public Health professor Sara Singer, and HBS professor Michael W. Toffel examine the effectiveness of organizational information campaigns and managerial role modeling in encouraging hospital staff to speak up when they encounter operational problems and, when speaking up, to propose solutions to hospital management. The researchers find that both mechanisms can lead employees to report problems and propose solutions, and that information campaigns are particularly effective in departments whose managers are less engaged in problem solving. Key concepts include: Front-line workers offer more solutions to operational problems in departments whose managers are more engaged in problem solving. Information campaigns that promote process improvement generate more solutions from front-line workers, especially from workers whose managers are less routinely engaged in problem solving.

1045,The Economic Crisis and Medical Care Usage,/item/the-economic-crisis-and-medical-care-usage,14 Apr 2010,"The global economic crisis has taken a historic toll on national economies and household finances around the world. What is the impact of such large shocks on individuals and their behavior, especially on their willingness to seek routine medical care? In this research, Annamaria Lusardi of Dartmouth College, Daniel Schneider of Princeton University, and Peter Tufano of Harvard Business School find strong evidence that the economic crisis—manifested in job and wealth losses—has led to large reductions in the use of routine medical care. Specifically, more than a quarter of Americans reported reducing their use of such care, as did between 5 and 12 percent of Canadian, French, German, and British respondents. Key concepts include: Large shares of Americans reduced their use of routine medical care since the economic crisis. These reductions were strongly related to economic distress brought on by the global financial crisis as measured by wealth loss and unemployment. The across-the-board reduction in medical care usage by Americans may speak to behavioral changes that reflect the national psyche broadly: The economic crisis in the United States—deeper and more widespread than elsewhere—may have touched the population at large, perhaps via negative expectations about the future. The cutbacks in health-care usage by people losing wealth or jobs, even in countries with ""universal"" systems, may reflect the fact that seeking care entails not only out-of-pocket expenses, but also costs of time away from work or job hunting. Reductions in routine care today might lead to undetected illness tomorrow and reduced individual health and well-being in the more distant future.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

Describing their study of hospitals over an 18-month period, HBS professor Anita L. Tucker and Harvard School of Public Health professor Sara J. Singer detail how and why managers' taking action was more effective than their communicating about actions taken. Findings suggest, first, that taking action on known problems in specific work areas on at least a quarterly basis may improve the organizational climate for improvement. Second, the study indicates that managers would be well advised to take action-preferably substantive and intense action-in response to frontline workers' communications about problems. Overall, the research provides insight for senior managers who want to improve their organization's climate for process improvement. Key concepts include: Resolving a small number of problems is better than collecting data about many problems. Giving feedback to employees about actions taken can worsen their perceptions of the climate for improvement if the actions were superficial or punitive. In other words, managers do not fool frontline workers by going through the motions of process improvement. The risk of surfacing a large number of problems is twofold: (1) identifying many problems simultaneously may overwhelm people with a new awareness of the full extent of problems within the organization, complicating and slowing decision processes and spreading already-stretched resources, and (2) it may reinforce cynicism among frontline workers that managers are uncommitted to improving the organizations' work systems.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

How can managers encourage frontline workers to solve problems in response to operational failures? In the health-care industry, the setting for this study, operational failures occur often, and some are reported to voluntary incident reporting systems that are meant to help organizations learn from experience. Using data on nearly 7,500 reported incidents from a single hospital, the researchers found that problem-solving in response to operational failures is influenced by both the risk posed by the incident and the extent to which management demonstrates a commitment to problem-solving. Findings can be used by organizations to increase the contribution of incident reporting systems to operational performance improvement. Key concepts include: Operational failures that trigger more financial and liability risks are associated with more frontline worker problem-solving. By communicating the importance of problem-solving and engaging in problem-solving themselves, line managers can stimulate increased problem-solving among frontline workers. Even without managers' regular engagement in problem-solving, communication about its importance can promote more problem-solving among frontline workers. By explaining some of the variation in responsiveness to operational failures, this study empowers managers to adjust their approach to stimulate more problem-solving among frontline workers.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health
1051,Input Constraints and the Efficiency of Entry: Lessons from Cardiac Surgery,/item/input-constraints-and-the-efficiency-of-entry-lessons-from-cardiac-surgery,17 Sep 2009,"Many professions rely on highly and variably skilled individuals. If a new firm is looking to enter a specific market, in addition to setting up a physical facility the company needs to hire or contract with specialized labor. In the short term, the supply of these specialists is relatively inelastic. From the point of view of economics, there remains a well-known potential for free entry to be inefficient when firms make entry decisions without internalizing the costs associated with the business they ""steal"" from incumbent firms. In 1996 Pennsylvania eliminated its certificate-of-need (CON) policy that had restricted entry by hospitals into expensive clinical programs, such as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) programs—leading to an increase from 43 to 63 in the number of hospitals providing this service. HBS professor Robert Huckman and coauthors examine the welfare implications of entry in the market for cardiac surgery. Key concepts include: Following the introduction of new CABG programs in Pennsylvania, volume shifted from incumbent programs to entrants and from lower- to higher-quality surgeons, thereby improving the overall quality of surgical outcomes. The repeal of CON in Pennsylvania improved the market for cardiac surgery by directing more volume to better doctors and increasing access to treatment.

Professors Regina E. Herzlinger, Robert Huckman, and Michael E. Porter take the pulse of a debate. Key concepts include: ""A government market with an underpriced Medicare would likely lead to the death of private-sector markets and products,"" say Professor Regina E. Herzlinger and coauthor Tom Coburn (R-OK). Patients would like the option of a public insurance plan, according to Professor Robert Huckman.

1054,Broadening Focus: Spillovers and the Benefits of Specialization in the Hospital Industry,/item/broadening-focus-spillovers-and-the-benefits-of-specialization-in-the-hospital-industry,07 May 2009,"What is the optimal scope of operations for firms? This question has particular relevance for the US hospital industry, because understanding the effects of focus and spillovers might help hospitals determine how they should balance focusing in a single clinical area with building expertise in related areas. While some scholars argue that narrowing an organization's set of activities improves its operational efficiency, others have noted that seemingly unfocused operations perform at a high level and that a broader range of activities may in fact increase firm value. This study by HBS doctoral student Jonathan Clark and professor Robert Huckman highlights the potential role of spillovers—specifically complementary spillovers—in generating benefits from focus at the operating unit level. Key concepts include: Hospitals devoting a greater portion of their business to treating patients in related service categories (i.e., those with the potential for knowledge spillovers) experience higher returns to specialization in a focal service. Ultimately, these results provide a potential explanation for why there might be decreasing returns to focusing an organization on a single operating activity (or narrow set of activities), especially when it is possible to invest in other activities that complement the organization's area of concentration.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

1056,Applying the Care Delivery Value Chain: HIV/AIDS Care in Resource Poor Settings,/item/applying-the-care-delivery-value-chain-hivaids-care-in-resource-poor-settings,03 Apr 2009,"The prevention and treatment of a complex disease such as HIV/AIDS in resource‐poor settings presents enormous challenges. Many of the social and economic factors that make populations living in these settings vulnerable to HIV/AIDS such as poverty, malnutrition, and political instability conspire to create barriers to effective care delivery. Understanding how interventions are related to each other and how local socioeconomic factors influence them is critical to effective program design. The Care Delivery Value Chain (CDVC) looks at care as an overall system, not as a series of discrete interventions, and describes the activities required to deliver care, illustrating their sequence and organization. Government agencies, philanthropic organizations, and non‐governmental organizations can use the framework to improve HIV/AIDS care delivery. Key concepts include: The CDVC framework allows one to outline and analyze the process of care delivery for a medical condition and provide maximize value for patients. The CDVC framework can map the activities associated with HIV/AIDS care delivery in resource-poor settings to illuminate effective linkage and coordination. The CDVC framework allows synthesis of knowledge about the overall system of care delivery and provides a common language for improving it.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

So let's try health care, too. According to HBS professor Clayton M. Christensen and coauthors of The Innovator's Prescription, such disruption to an industry might look like a threat, but it ""always proves to be an extraordinary growth opportunity."" Book excerpt. Key concepts include: Most disruptions have three enablers: a simplifying technology, a business model innovation, and a disruptive value network. Business model innovations are almost always forged by new entrants to an industry. Disruption of an industry rarely happens piecemeal. It is more common that entirely new value networks arise, displacing the old. Always, the technological enablers of disruption are successfully deployed against an industry's simplest problems first.

Why is India leading in the globalization of medical services? Q&A with Harvard Business School's Tarun Khanna. Key concepts include: Medical tourism is a new term but not a new idea. Patients have long traveled in search of better care. Today, constraints and long waiting lists at home, as well as the ease of global travel, make medical tourism more appealing. Superior medical schools, a low cost of living, family preferences, and the barriers to foreign accreditation mean that Indian doctors may prefer to work in India rather than elsewhere. The medical services industry is evolving quickly.

1063,Improving Patient Outcomes: The Effects of Staff Participation and Collaboration in Healthcare Delivery,/item/improving-patient-outcomes-the-effects-of-staff-participation-and-collaboration-in-healthcare-delivery,14 Aug 2007,"Health-care organizations have a well-documented, industry-wide need to improve their processes. To that aim, the Institute of Medicine has made at least 2 recommendations that focus on front-line staff—physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists. The first recommendation states that front-line staff should be involved in unit decision-making and the design of work processes and workflow (participation). The second emphasizes respectful interactions among front-line staff, including information-sharing and coordinating activities to achieve organizational goals (collaboration). This study provides preliminary supporting evidence for the Institute of Medicine's recommendations to use a dual, front-line strategy of participation and collaboration to improve patient outcomes. Key concepts include: Shared decision-making and respectful collaboration are vital to enabling improvement in health-care organizations. Front-line staff participation in process improvement can solve a common problem: lack of commitment from health-care professionals to implement new practices. Units with more collaboration—as measured by staff perception and use of collaborative work practices—experienced greater improvement in risk-adjusted mortality among patients. Participation in process improvement may be an effective strategy for other service organizations that face staff resistance to new routines.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

He and colleagues at the Harvard School of Public Health have embarked on a new project to serve this critical sector. Bringing together public healthcare and market forces ""could have huge impact,"" he says. Key concepts include: Poverty is defined by three billion people in the world living on less than $2 a day. Public health as a private good should be complementary to public health as a public good, not in opposition to it. Project Antares wants to take high-impact initiatives and deliver them through commercial means. Part of its measure of success is whether a higher percentage of the population is helped than would be otherwise. Poverty cannot be tamed with a single solution.

This new research looks deeper at learning curves by focusing on learning rates in technology adoption in similar organizations along multiple, potentially competing dimensions. Using longitudinal data from sixteen hospitals that are adopting a new technology for cardiac surgery, it specifically studies two dimensions: efficiency and application innovation and the potential tradeoff between efficiency and application innovation. It also asks how such tradeoffs are influenced. Key concepts include: Organizations should explicitly decide which dimension of learning is of greatest strategic importance to them. Some organizations may learn more slowly on a particular dimension because they are investing in a different, potentially contradictory dimension of learning. Hospitals in the study that focused on increasing the technical difficulty and innovativeness of their use of a new technology were less likely to increase efficiency as quickly as those that were focused on efficiency.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

Practices involve people and knowledge; people must apply knowledge to particular situations, so changing practices requires changing behavior. This study is a starting point for healthcare organizations to improve work practices. The researchers drew from literature on best practice transfer, team learning, and process change and developed four hypotheses to test at highly specialized hospital units that care for premature infants and critically ill newborns. Key concepts include: Organizations must set up project teams to investigate and implement new practices. Project teams are important for creating organizational change. There is a strong positive relationship between ""learn-how"" and implementation success. ""Learn-how"" makes new practices work in a specific context, and psychological safety encourages people to participate in this disruptive process.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Health

Could PRT change the face of public transportation in cities and smaller communities? HBS professor Benjamin G. Edelman weighs the benefits and opportunities for entrepreneurs and for society. ""Right now, the field is wide open,"" he says. Key concepts include: A typical PRT vehicle carries one to four passengers along a dedicated track. It travels direct routes—no stops along the way—using computer control. Although it sounds futuristic, the PRT concept has been discussed seriously by engineers, designers, and academics since the mid-1950s. A PRT system has been in use since 1972 at the University of West Virginia in Morgantown. An installation at London's Heathrow Airport is slated to open in 2010. Yet general skepticism remains prevalent. PRT could reduce traffic congestion by offering a strong alternative to the private automobile. Other opportunities include establishing PRT systems on corporate or educational campuses, ultimately reducing costly and intrusive parking garages. PRT systems could also improve the value of real estate on land that is not close enough to other public transportation or services.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Travel, Logistics and Transport Infrastructure"

1232,Merchant or Two-Sided Platform?,/item/merchant-or-two-sided-platform,21 Jun 2007,"With ever more sophisticated logistics and the rise of information technologies, intermediaries and market platforms have become increasingly ubiquitous and important agents in the digital economy. While market intermediation is not a new phenomenon, the digital economy has revealed that there can be two polar types of intermediaries: ""merchants,"" which acquire goods from sellers and resell them to buyers, and ""two-sided platforms,"" which allow affiliated sellers to sell directly to affiliated buyers. As examples, retailers like Walmart.com and Amazon.com are (mostly) merchants; eBay is a pure two-sided platform; and Apple's iTunes digital music store exhibits both merchant and platform features. This research is a first pass at delineating the economic tradeoffs between the merchant and two-sided platform modes. Key concepts include: Economic tradeoffs are affected by several fundamental economic factors: indirect network effects between buyers and sellers; asymmetric information between sellers and the intermediary; and investment incentives, product complementarities, and substitutability. This analysis holds true for a monopoly intermediary. With competing intermediaries, more subtle strategic issues may arise that are beyond the scope of this research.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"
1233,Multi-Sided Platforms: From Microfoundations to Design and Expansion Strategies,/item/multi-sided-platforms-from-microfoundations-to-design-and-expansion-strategies,21 Jun 2007,"The term ""platform"" is increasingly popular among executives today. Platforms, and multi-sided platforms (MSPs) in particular, serve the needs of interdependent constituents. Although MSPs have existed for centuries in the form of matchmakers and village markets, information technology has increased tremendously the opportunities for building larger, more powerful, and more valuable platforms. At the same time, by expanding the potential scope of platforms, information technology has also increased the number and complexity of factors, both economic and technical, that drive the strategic design of MSPs. Surprisingly, few companies rigorously analyze the underlying drivers of their MSPs, and the emerging business and economics literature on two-sided markets has not been very helpful in this direction, either. This article provides a general framework to help organize managerial thinking about MSPs. Key concepts include: This framework is useful because it induces systematic analysis of MSP strategic opportunities and the critical tradeoffs involved, based on fundamental economic functions that cut across any specific industry setting. Strategic design defines the relevant space in which the MSP operates, its multiple constituents, and its competitors, both actual and potential. Designing and expanding MSPs is a complex, daunting, and, most importantly, dynamic process. The most successful MSPs are constantly evolving. While this dynamism is especially true in high-tech markets, even traditional businesses can unlock powerful sources of indirect network effects with a little technological help and a good amount of creativity. The devil is in the details.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"
1234,Evolution Analysis of Large-Scale Software Systems Using Design Structure Matrices and Design Rule Theory,/item/evolution-analysis-of-large-scale-software-systems-using-design-structure-matrices-and-design-rule-theory,14 Jun 2007,"Designers have long recognized the value of modularity. But because design principles are informal, successful application depends on the designers' intuition and experience. Intuition and experience, however, do not prevent a company such as Microsoft from constantly grappling with unanticipated challenges and delays in bringing software to market. Clearly, designers need a formal theory and models of modularity and software evolution that capture the essence of important but informal design principles and offer ways to describe, predict, and resolve issues. This paper evaluates the applicability of model and theory to real-world, large-scale software designs by studying the evolution of two complex software platforms through the lens of design structure matrices (DSMs) and the design rule theory advanced by Kim Clark and Carliss Baldwin. Key concepts include: Important software modularity principles have remained informal. DSM models reveal a key characteristic of modular architectures: The design rules must be explicitly defined so that otherwise dependent modules can be decoupled. Each independent module can then be replaced with a better version. DSM modeling and the design rule theory of Clark and Baldwin have the potential to formally account for how design rules create options in the form of independent modules and how they enable independent substitution. DSM modeling and design rule theory are general enough to model decisions other than those encoded in source code.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

But is there an attendant risk to civic society, as some scholars claim? Do locally engaged citizens turn into passive viewers? The explosion in the U.S. of local television news in Spanish provides an ideal stage for probing these questions. This paper tests whether the presence of local television news affects local civic engagement in the form of voter turnout.

Can Apple and the recording industry seriously compete against free? Do iTunes and p2p help each other in some ways? Professor Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and collaborator Andres Hervas-Drane discuss their recent research on competition in digital distribution. Key concepts include: ITunes demonstrates that to compete effectively against free p2p networks, online digital distribution must deliver experiences to consumers that cannot be easily matched by decentralized, self-sustained peer-to-peer networks. In designing new models, managers must consider how robust a given design is to models of other industry participants with which they interact. Managers must also ponder how aggressive their business models are toward those of other players and ask whether or not complementarities are exploited. The ""scarce"" resource in digital goods distribution through p2p networks is not content, but bandwidth. As a consequence, ISPs will have a more visible role in shaping industry structure.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"
1237,How Do You Value a “Free” Customer?,/item/how-do-you-value-a-free-customer,07 Mar 2007,"Sometimes a valuable customer may be the person who never buys a thing. In a new research paper, Professor Sunil Gupta discusses how to assess the profitability of a customer in a networked setting—a ""free"" customer who nevertheless influences your bottom line. Key concepts include: In multi-sided markets, some customers contribute to a company's bottom line directly while others contribute indirect benefits, which are more difficult to calculate. Businesses must be able to assess the value of these ""free"" customers in order to efficiently allocate marketing and other expenses to grow the business, and to develop a more accurate estimate of firm value. Using a model for valuing networked customers, Gupta found that in an auction scenario, buyers and sellers had almost equal value even though sellers outnumbered buyers 4.6-to-1.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

As Andrew McAfee and colleagues argue in this study, the appropriate governance mechanism for an IT-facilitated collaboration depends on the type of IT being deployed: When an enterprise technology is required, so is an electronic hierarchy. The paper explores the issue of relationship specificity of IT assets, proposes a categorization of information technologies based on their levels of relationship specificity, and uses data from more than forty Italian industrial districts to test three hypotheses around governance of interfirm IT. These districts typically have close ties, both horizontal and vertical, and have historically worked in close collaboration with each other. Key concepts include: When an enterprise technology is required, so is an electronic hierarchy. Future research could reveal if there is a general pattern in relationship-specific investments and how entities other than powerful incumbent firms can successfully build electronic hierarchies. Future research could also help define the full spectrum of IT-based interactions and the appropriate governance mechanisms for each.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

Increasingly, however, Chinese technologists and entrepreneurs are returning home rather than staying in the U.S. to pursue opportunities. Professor William Kerr discusses the phenomena of technology transfer and implications for U.S.-based businesses and policymakers. From New Business. Key concepts include: The trend of Chinese technologists and entrepreneurs returning home rather than staying in the U.S. is a trend that potentially offers both harm and opportunity to U.S.-based interests. Immigrants account for almost half of Ph.D.-level scientists and engineers in the U.S. and are strong contributors to American technology development. It is in the United States' interest to attract and retain this highly skilled group. U.S. multinationals are placing larger shares of their R&D into foreign countries, around 15 percent today.

1240,The Business of Free Software,/item/the-business-of-free-software,15 Jan 2007,"Breaking with a largely proprietary tradition, large IT vendors have invested several billion dollars into open-source software development. What's their motivation? The observations presented in research by professor Marco Iansiti and coauthor Gregory L. Richards suggest some fundamental changes in strategy used by technology companies. Key concepts include: IT vendors that traditionally have relied on proprietary-software development are increasingly turning to the open source software community to create pieces of their products. Many IT vendors invest in open source projects that draw customers to a vendor's mainly proprietary, core businesses—the razor/razor blade approach. This trend is changing some classic rules of strategy and forcing IT vendors to reconsider not only how they develop software but also where they derive value in their business models.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

Why do information technology vendors that have traditionally sold proprietary software invest millions of dollars in OSS? Where have they chosen to invest, and what are the characteristics of the OSS projects to which they contribute? This study grouped OSS projects into clusters and identified IT vendors' motives in each cluster. Key concepts include: Cluster 1, the ""money-driven cluster,"" consisted of projects that have received almost all of vendor investments. The eighteen projects in this cluster have received over $2 billion in investment. Cluster 2, the ""community-driven cluster,"" has a large number of projects that have received almost no vendor investment. IT vendors have generally ignored projects in this cluster and appear to have no coordinated strategy for dealing with them. Examining the impact of projects in both clusters shows that vendors have not invested uniformly in high-impact OSS projects. Instead, vendors invest in projects that can serve to draw revenues to their own (largely proprietary) core business.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

While many researchers have examined (either separately or together) corporate research and development and technology diffusion, they run into two significant data constraints. William R. Kerr and Shihe Fu describe how they developed a new dataset for studying corporate innovation that encompasses three important existing datasets. This paper summarizes the Industry R&D Survey for researchers who want to study innovation through the Census Bureau's data. Key concepts include: The developed platform offers an unprecedented view of the R&D-to-patenting innovation process and a close analysis of the strengths and limitations of the Industry R&D Survey. This R&S platform can, through the Census Bureau's file structure, facilitate other studies of how innovation leads to productivity.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

But can the long tail work for video sales as well? A new working paper by professors Anita Elberse and Felix Oberholzer-Gee suggests that it may not bring the same benefits to Hollywood. Key concepts include: For video sales, the long-tail phenomenon is not as pronounced at it is for books. There is evidence of a shift in sales to the tail for video, but an increasing number of titles do not sell at all. Hollywood strategists have no easy answers for pumping up revenue, given a decline in the number of blockbuster hits. This new research suggests that the long-tail phenomenon might not be a panacea for video sales. The music industry may be more of a long-tail beneficiary than the movie industry.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

But what impact has IT had on competition? This paper identifies several recent changes in the competitive dynamics of U.S. industries and shows that they are associated with IT intensity; the more IT and industry has, the greater the changes. Using case studies, previous research, and a simple model, the authors offer a theory that explains these patterns in the data. They argue that IT allows the rapid spread of business process innovations, which in turn leads to more turbulent and concentrated industries. Key concepts include: Since the mid-1990s, IT-intensive industries have seen higher levels of turbulence and concentration growth than have non-IT-intensive industries. The improved ability of firms to replicate business innovations affects not only productivity, but also the nature of business competition itself. Future research on the competitive impact of IT within a single industry could use case studies combined with economy-wide data analysis. This method would help clarify the impetus for technology investments, their timing, and their effects.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"
1248,Architectural Innovation and Dynamic Competition: The Smaller “Footprint” Strategy,/item/architectural-innovation-and-dynamic-competition-the-smaller-footprint-strategy,28 Sep 2006,"To study dynamic competition, Baldwin and Clark build upon a design principle in computer architecture known as Amdahl's Law. The authors show that firms can study the underlying cause-and-effect relationships in a complex architecture in order to identify ""bottlenecks."" Firms may then redesign the interfaces of key components to make them more modular. They can then outsource more activities without sacrificing performance or cost. As a result, firms can offer competitive products or services, while investing less, and so enjoy an ""invested capital advantage"" over competitors. Baldwin and Clark explain how the strategy works and then model its impact on competition through successive stages of industry evolution. Key concepts include: Architectural innovation involves rearranging known parts (components) into new patterns (architectures) to achieve higher levels of system performance on one or more dimensions. The strategy described in this paper was used in the 1980s by Sun Microsystems against Apollo Computer and in the 1990s by Dell against Compaq and other personal computer makers. Sun's invested capital advantage can be linked to specific architectural innovations. As for Dell, indirect evidence shows that architectural knowledge and innovation contributed in important ways to Dell's success.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"
1249,How Software Platforms Revolutionize Business,/item/how-software-platforms-revolutionize-business,25 Sep 2006,"Cell phones, the Game Boy, and PCs are examples of products based upon software platforms—ecosystems where independent companies can provide products and services tied to the core technology. Playing in a software platform world can make you rich—ask ringtone creators—but it also demands special management skills that emphasize cooperation over competition. Professor Andrei Hagiu discusses his new book, Invisible Engines. Key concepts include: Software platforms have improved productivity and innovation in many industries, disrupted or destroyed others, and created entirely new businesses. Software platforms are powerful engines of change because of the malleability of code and of the fundamental functions they perform, which make it easy for them to march across industry boundaries; and because their multi-sided nature allows them to spawn vibrant ecosystems of complementors. Managing software platforms is about much more than creating technology. It takes skills in navigating cooperation and competition, building creative business models, and anticipating competition across industries.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

But can specific products also ""absorb"" a firm's knowledge of related technologies? Using patent data and the example of automobile carburetors, Daniel Snow studied how companies may adapt a component of a ""radical innovation"" technology for their own current-technology products. He also poses a far-reaching question for companies: Can they capture the returns of these inventive activities? Key concepts include: Firms that have experience working with a ""future technology"" or radical innovation can efficiently adapt components from such innovations for their own current-technology products. They are also more likely to adapt such components. For any positive effects, the future-technology components should already be closely related to the product's current components. Whether firms can capture the returns of their own inventive activity may boil down to the fact that intellectual property is difficult to protect: The possibility of free-riding may affect firms' willingness to invest in future technologies.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

Linda A. Hill and Maria Farkas, a doctoral student, examine this question against the backdrop of post-apartheid South Africa. Focusing on the efforts of one successful black executive to recruit and develop other minority managers and integrate blacks into the mainstream economy, Hill and Farkas explore fundamental ethical and business issues affecting companies and society at large. Key concepts include: In assessing the economic or ethical soundness of a leader's decisions, the impact of his or her actions over time must be considered. All business people around the world need to think about the appropriate role of business in addressing inequality. This example of efforts in South Africa may offer valuable insights for addressing inequality elsewhere in the globe.

In the production process, the authors recommend risk management and portfolio management for studios, and explore talent compensation issues. Distribution trends show that box-office performance will increasingly depend on a small number of blockbusters, advertising spending will rise (but will cross different types of media), and the timing of releases (and DVDs) will become a bigger issue. As for exhibiting movies, trends show that more sophisticated exhibitors will emerge, contractual changes between distributor and exhibitors will change, and strategies for tickets prices may be reevaluated. Key concepts include: Business tools such as quantitative and qualitative research and market research should be applied to the decision-making process at earlier stages of development. Technological developments will continue to have unknown effects on every stage of the movie-making value chain (production, distribution, exhibition, consumption).Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

Products that used to be designed and manufactured by a single firm are now produced by different companies that must coordinate activities. Here, the authors detail the relationship between Intel and Microsoft (both integral to PCs) and, using a mixed-duopoly model, analyze the dynamics of cooperation verses competition. They find that costs associated with complementary R&D, conflicts of interest in pricing, and the possibility of competitors all factor in the decision of when to cooperate or compete. Key concepts include: Complementary companies tend to compete on issues of price. For example, if one sells high (Intel's microprocessors) then another must sell low (Microsoft's software) in order for a product (a PC) to be able to sell at a profit. Complementors should weigh the costs and benefits of encouraging competition in each others' spaces.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

To track the evolution of one design over time, this exploratory study compared software designs developed via different modes of organization-open source versus proprietary development. As it turned out, the architecture of the product developed by a highly distributed team of developers (Linux) was more modular than another product of similar size developed by a co-located team of developers (Mozilla). The study helped reveal potential performance tradeoffs from architectures with different characteristics. Key concepts include: The value of design is a managerial choice. There are important, measurable differences in modularity between different software systems of comparable size and function. Systems may vary dramatically in terms of their robustness to change, and the costs and efficiency of future enhancements.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

The authors use data on advertising expenditures and an online stock market simulation, The Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX), to track more than 280 movies released between 2001 and 2003. Their findings show that advertising affects the updating of market-wide expectations prior to release, and that this effect is stronger the higher the product quality.

Often the only auction information participants have is the number of bidders, observed bids, and product characteristics. If data from an auction, for instance, is a function of bidder behavior, then external survey data may help in testing hypotheses about bidding behavior. Researchers often avoid using surveys because they consume time and effort, but Yin presents a survey design technique and econometric tool to deal with a general population of survey respondents. Her application tested eBay online auctions selling personal computers. Key concepts include: Survey data may be a good complement for market data, especially for auctions, as a measure of uncertainty or different preferences. Survey data may be more valuable than other methods of evaluation because it exploits the human ability to assess complex sets of information. A survey may be implemented more quickly with a larger number of respondents, even if they are inexperienced, than with a smaller number of experienced respondents, by correcting for survey bias.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

Millions of people use Internet auctions for goods that are often of unknown value (e.g., used goods, unknown brands). This paper asks: Do bidders behave in the way auction theory predicts they should? And, what are the effects of different types of information on prices? To answer these questions, Yin combined theory, econometric modeling, and survey data. Key concepts include: Reputation lends credibility to the information about the product; both are important when analyzing auction prices. Information in auctions is dispersed among many participants. In analysis, this dispersion is a more important source of uncertainty than any information asymmetry between buyer and seller.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.","Technology, Media & Telecommunications"

Potential customers have little or no experience with products, and during this period of turbulence, firms experiment with alternative product configurations, functions, and technologies. By studying the emergence of the consumer mass market for digital cameras, Carlson School of Management professor Mary J. Benner and HBS professor Mary Tripsas explore what factors influence a firm's initial introduction of product features during the nascent stage of a product market, and how the process of convergence on a standard set of features unfolds. In particular, they assess how a firm's prior industry affiliation influences its conceptualization of the product. Key concepts include: The authors used a dataset that includes the entry date and features of almost every camera in the history of the U.S. consumer digital camera industry from its inception in 1991 through 2006. Results suggest that firms from the same prior industry shared similar beliefs about what features (such as optical zoom) would be valued, as reflected in their concurrent introduction of features. Firms were likely to imitate the behavior of firms from the same prior industry, as opposed to that of firms from different prior industries, in introducing some but not all features. Finally, as a firm's experience with a particular feature increased, the influence of prior industry decreased.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Electronics

For the pharmaceutical industry, the ACA is likely to prove a mixed blessing. In this paper, Assistant Professor Arthur Daemmrich analyzes the political economy of health care, specifically concerning health care reform. He then considers how the ACA will affect the pharmaceutical sector, both quantitatively in terms of the size of the prescription drug market and qualitatively in terms of industry structure and competitive dynamics. Daemmrich also places the current reforms into historical context and describes the political negotiations that enabled passage of the ACA. Key concepts include: Since the United States is the world's largest prescription drug market and has among the fewest price control mechanisms, the ACA holds significance to pharmaceutical firms internationally. Over the course of its implementation in coming years, the ACA will significantly expand prescription drug use, including at the relative expense of other health services. In 2015, Daemmrich projects pharmaceutical spending between $435 and $440 billion (12.5 percent of total health care spending) and in 2020 it will near $700 billion (14 percent of total health care spending). Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services will be hard pressed to explain increased drug spending to consumers, especially compared to Europe and Japan where reference pricing (capping prices at an average within a therapeutic category or among peer countries) has become the norm. The ACA nevertheless holds the potential for the United States to be the first country to break out of the silo framework that dominates health budgeting in countries using reference price systems and to instead set budgets at the disease (or patient) level, linked to health outcomes.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Pharmaceuticals & Medical Products

1336,Where is the Pharmacy to the World? International Regulatory Variation and Pharmaceutical Industry Location,/item/where-is-the-pharmacy-to-the-world-international-regulatory-variation-and-pharmaceutical-industry-location,22 Apr 2009,"The era of paternalistic medicine has passed, but the notion that patients can act as consumers and make appropriate decisions concerning medical treatment poses countervailing risks of its own. A better accommodation among key players needs to be struck to foster the safe use of pharmaceuticals, according to HBS professor Arthur Daemmrich. The ""pharmacy to the world,"" once located at the intersection of Germany, Switzerland, and France, today is found in the United States. Studies of the industry have attributed this sustained competitive advantage to a variety of factors, including U.S. intellectual property policies, funding for biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health, the absence of government controls on drug prices, and the availability of venture capital and other factors that fostered the growth of the biotechnology industry. The data and analysis presented in this working paper, however speculative, are an initial step toward deepening the understanding of interrelationships between government regulation, patients' mobilization both as regulators and as consumers, and the functioning of the pharmaceutical industry. Key concepts include: An open question is whether the current ""pharmacy to the world"" of the United States will lose ground to competitors from developing countries, especially India and China. Regulation plays a role in the success and failure of the pharmaceutical industry. The consumer mode that has emerged in the United States has proven easy to manipulate for the industry, as in cases of corporate-financed organizations claiming to be self-organized by patients. The consumer mode in the United States has also driven a focus on disease prevalent in wealthy countries, to the detriment of research into HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other ailments prevalent in the developing world. The combination of public attention to drug prices, health concerns from product withdrawals due to adverse reactions, and criticisms of the failure to deliver medicines to patients in developing countries pose significant challenges to the industry and regulators. The emergence of a consumer model of regulation poses a number of critical, unresolved questions about the longer-term role of government, industry, the medical profession, and citizens.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Pharmaceuticals & Medical Products

1338,Competition in Modular Clusters,/item/competition-in-modular-clusters,17 Jan 2008,"The last 20 years have witnessed the rise of disaggregated ""clusters,"" ""networks,"" or ""ecosystems"" of firms in a number of industries, including computers, telecommunications, and pharmaceuticals. In these clusters, different firms design and produce the various components of a complex artifact (such as the processor, peripherals, and software of a computer system), and different firms specialize in the various stages of a complex production process. This paper considers the pricing behavior and profitability of these so-called modular clusters. Baldwin and Woodard isolate the offsetting price effects in a model, and show how they might operate in large as well as in small clusters. Key concepts include: Clusters operating under open, public standards may have higher prices and profits than those operating under closed, proprietary standards. Cluster forms of industrial organization may not be conducive to all kinds of innovation. In particular, innovations that add new layers of functionality to the system, and thus increase total demand, will not be adequately rewarded relative to the value they create. It is important to learn how cluster configurations affect incentives to supply different forms of innovation, and how firms respond to these cross-layer dependencies in formulating their long-term strategies.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Pharmaceuticals & Medical Products

Patients have long traveled in search of better care. Today, constraints and long waiting lists at home, as well as the ease of global travel, make medical tourism more appealing. Superior medical schools, a low cost of living, family preferences, and the barriers to foreign accreditation mean that Indian doctors may prefer to work in India rather than elsewhere. The medical services industry is evolving quickly. Khanna expects to see dynamics in China similar to those in India and in other parts of Southeast Asia.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Pharmaceuticals & Medical Products

The authors explore R&D performance volatility using the pharmaceutical industry as the model. The study looks at two types of heuristics that are commonly used to manage R&D project portfolios: (1) which products to start, and whether to continue or kill a product in development; (2) how resources should be allocated at each phase of development. By changing the heuristics used to make decisions at each stage of development, managers can decrease the amount of uncertainty and failure in the R&D process. Key concepts include: Pay attention to R&D portfolio management, not just portfolio selection. Don't delay in killing bad projects.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Pharmaceuticals & Medical Products

1376,Do Display Ads Influence Search? Attribution and Dynamics in Online Advertising,/item/do-display-ads-influence-search-attribution-and-dynamics-in-online-advertising,28 Feb 2013,"The introduction of online metrics such as click through rate (CTR) and cost per acquisition (CPA) by Google and other online advertisers has made it easy for marketing managers to justify their online ad spending in comparison to the budgets used for television and other media. However, these metrics suffer from two fundamental problems: (a) they do not account for attribution, since they give credit to the last click and ignore the impact of other ad formats that may have helped a consumer move down the conversion funnel, and (b) they ignore the dynamics, since they only account for the immediate impact of ads. As firms spend more of their ad dollars on online search and display, managers and researchers alike recognize a need for more careful attribution adjustment that takes into account the journey consumers follow before conversion as well as account for the impact of ads over time. In this paper, the authors use time series models to infer the interaction between search and display ads and also capture their impact over time. Examining data from a bank that used online advertising to acquire new customers for its checking account, the authors found that display ads have a significant impact on search applications, as well as clicks. The majority of this spillover was not instant, but took effect only after two weeks. On the other hand, search advertising did not lead to an increase in display applications. However, search ads showed significant dynamic effects on search applications that made them very cost effective in the long run. Key concepts include: Classic metrics used in practice are highly biased since they do not account for the effects documented in this study. As a result, firms may be making suboptimal budget allocation decisions. Managers should carefully consider the interaction and dynamic effects of search and display advertising. In the study, revised measures of ad effectiveness lead to a very different budget allocation than the one used currently by the firm. Even though the proposed allocation gives credit to display due to its effect on search applications, the search ad budget should be increased by 36% from its current level due to its strong dynamic effects. The display ad budget should be decreased by 31%.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

Professor Alvin J. Silk traces the evolution and current state of industry practices with respect to conflict norms and policies; reviews the body of conceptual and empirical research that is available about the sources and consequences of conflicts, and outlines some directions for future research to address unresolved policy issues. Key concepts include: Historically, advertising agencies in the US and Europe did not simultaneously serve accounts or clients who were competitors. Safeguards to preserve proprietary information have become an essential component of conflict policies. Rival clients may be served by separate organizational units that are under common control and/or ownership. A family of hybrid conflict policies has evolved that features elements of the split account system long practiced in Japan, augmented by safeguards that serve as partial substitutes for the umbrella prohibition on serving rivals imposed by exclusivity. By relying on safeguards and splitting account assignments among different organizational units within or across a mega-agency or holding company, clients exert a measure of control over those agencies' access to confidential information while also offering them incentives to avoid conflicts of interest.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

A new working paper, ""To Groupon or Not to Groupon,"" sets out to help small businesses decide. Harvard Business School professor Benjamin G. Edelman discusses the paper's findings. Key concepts include: Discount vouchers provide price discrimination, letting merchants attract consumers who would not ordinarily patronize their business without a major price incentive. These vouchers also benefit merchants through advertising, simply by informing consumers of a merchant's existence via e-mail. For some merchants, the benefits of offering discount vouchers are sharply reduced if individual customers buy multiple vouchers. As a marketing tool, discount vouchers are likely to be most effective for businesses that are relatively unknown and have low marginal costs.Closed for comment; 59 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising
1383,Sponsored Links’ or ’Advertisements’?: Measuring Labeling Alternatives in Internet Search Engines,/item/sponsored-links-or-advertisements-measuring-labeling-alternatives-in-internet-search-engines,30 Nov 2010,"In processing a search for a particular phrase, Internet search engines generally offer two types of results: the algorithmic results, which a search engine selects based on relevance, and the ""sponsored links,"" for which advertisers pay. The latter often occupy prominent screen space. But does the average web surfer realize that they are advertisements? In an online experiment, Harvard Business School professor Benjamin Edelman and doctoral candidate Duncan S. Gilchrist show that ""sponsored link"" is too vague a term for some users to understand, and that ""paid advertisement"" is a label that better clarifies the nature of the link. They call on the FTC to compel search engines to improve their disclosures. Key concepts include: Through October 2010, leading search engines Google, Yahoo!, and Bing presented their advertisements with the labels ""sponsored links,"" ""sponsored results,"" and ""sponsored sites,"" respectively. (In November, Google substituted the term ""ads."") In an online experiment that replaced these labels with the term ""paid advertisement,"" users were up to 33 percent less likely to click on the sponsored link. Certain categories of users were particularly influenced by the improved label. The improved labels had largest effect on users without college degrees, users with annual income below $100,000, and users who utilize the web less than 12 hours per week. The Federal Trade Commission has called for ""clear and conspicuous disclosures"" to label search advertisements. Because available evidence suggests users do not understand widely used labels, the researchers believe the FTC should require search engines to use the label ""advertisement"" or ""paid advertisement"" rather than vague or easily overlooked alternatives.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising
1384,The Unbundling of Advertising Agency Services: An Economic Analysis,/item/the-unbundling-of-advertising-agency-services-an-economic-analysis,09 Nov 2010,"From 1982 through 2007, U.S. advertising agencies increasingly ""unbundled,"" or disaggregated, services such as copywriting and media placement, moving away from the industry's traditional one-stop-shop model. At the same time, agencies began to charge clients based on a fee-for-service system, rather than collecting commissions on media placements. The researchers analyze this trend and consider how it may be interpreted by the economic theory of bundling. Key concepts include: Agencies are more likely to unbundle services with increasing size and diversification but are less likely to do so with increasing age. A strong trend toward unbundling over time is evident, a result partially explained by increases in media prices during the study period. With the arrival of new media technologies and lower-priced digital ads, holding companies are considering re-organizing their media agencies with digital and other capabilities so as to position themselves as offering clients broader ""marketing solutions"" beyond media planning and buying. Such ""re-bundling"" may also reflect the lower prices for digital advertising.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising
1385,Competing Ad Auctions,/item/competing-ad-auctions,22 Jan 2010,"Joining ad platforms can attract substantial regulatory attention: In November 2008, the Department of Justice planned to file antitrust charges to stop the proposed Google-Yahoo transaction. More recently, in September 2009, the Department of Justice sought additional information from Microsoft and Yahoo about their proposed partnership. At first glance it might seem paradoxical to claim that the Google-Yahoo transaction is undesirable, for advertisers and for the economy as a whole, while the Microsoft-Yahoo transaction offers net benefits. But that conclusion is entirely possible. HBS professor Benjamin G. Edelman and doctoral candidates Itai Ashlagi and Hoan Soo Lee explore competition among ad platforms that offer search engine advertising services. In addition, the authors evaluate possible transactions among ad platforms—building tools to predict which transactions improve welfare and which impede it. Key concepts include: Participation costs exist and matter, affecting bidders' decisions about which ad platforms to use, and changing the welfare consequences of mergers or joins among platforms. By creating a joined ad platform of larger size than Microsoft or Yahoo alone, the transaction lets advertisers spread participation costs over a larger purchase, making it worthwhile for small to midsize advertisers to sign up with the joined Microsoft-Yahoo platform even though they do not use Microsoft or Yahoo separately. Preventing a competing platform from attracting advertisers reduces the quality of that competing platform (fewer ads yielding an inferior match with users' searches), cuts that platform's revenue (impeding future investment), and generally hinders that platform's efforts at growth.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising
1386,Strategies to Fight Ad-sponsored Rivals,/item/strategies-to-fight-ad-sponsored-rivals,22 Oct 2009,"Many companies choose to finance themselves using ad revenues and offer their products or services—from newspapers to software applications, television programs, and online search—free to consumers. Yet the emergence of ad-sponsored entrants in various industries poses significant threats to the incumbents in these markets whose business models are often based on subscriptions or fees charged to their customers. Faced with the threat from ad-sponsored entrants, incumbents must choose strategies to respond. HBS professor Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and University of Southern California professor Feng Zhu create an analytical framework to establish guidelines for incumbent firms facing these issues. The researchers consider four alternative business models: pure-subscription-based; pure-ad-sponsored; mixed-single-product; and mixed-product-line-extension. Analysis shows that the optimal strategic and tactical choices change dramatically in the presence of an ad-sponsored rival. This is the first study to provide a comprehensive analysis of the competition between a free ad-sponsored entrant and an incumbent that has the option of choosing different business models. Key concepts include: The presence of the ad-sponsored rival puts an upper bound on the number of ads that an incumbent competing through a mixed-product-line-extension can set. When the advertising rate is low, a mixed-product-line-extension model is inferior to the pure-subscription-based model. Even if the incumbent can avoid cannibalization by using a mixed-single-product model, the incumbent may still prefer to use the pure-subscription-based model, since the advertising intensities of the two firms are strategic substitutes. Sometimes the best response of the incumbent to an ad-sponsored entrant is to not change its business model and tactics. This happens only when the optimal business model under both monopoly and duopoly is the pure-subscription-based model, and when the quality difference between the incumbent and the entrant is large.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

1391,Concentration Levels in the U.S. Advertising and Marketing Services Industry: Myth vs. Reality,/item/concentration-levels-in-the-u-s-advertising-and-marketing-services-industry-myth-vs-reality,18 Dec 2008,"How concentrated is the U.S. advertising and marketing services industry? Over the past several decades, the effects of deregulation, globalization, and technological innovation have reshaped the advertising and marketing services industry as they worked their way through the economy. Estimates from the existing literature are typically based on data from trade sources and present a picture that emphasizes rising concentration over time and domination by a handful of holding companies. These estimates are suspect as they suffer from a number of conceptual and measurement limitations. This paper analyzes changes in concentration levels in the U.S. advertising and marketing services industry, using data that have been largely ignored in past discussions of the economic organization of the industry. Key concepts include: Concentration levels vary across the advertising and marketing service industry's nine sectors, but all are within the range generally considered indicative of a competitive industry. From 1977 to 1992, census data show that the number of firms and establishments and the level of agency receipts in real terms increased. After 1992, however, the number of firms and establishments decreased while real agency receipts have continued to grow, and concentration levels have tended to increase. Between 2002 and 2006, the four largest holding companies captured a fifth to a fourth of the total U.S. revenue flowing to suppliers of advertising and marketing services each year. After several waves of mergers and acquisitions, the collective position of the major holding companies in the United States is considerably less than dominant.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

Cost efficiencies and savings are the major reasons for pursuing the in-house advertising route. Some industries more than others develop in-house advertising expertise, particularly technology-based and creative industries. The make or buy decision relating to advertising services is complex, and should be based on a careful economic analysis.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising
1393,Securing Online Advertising: Rustlers and Sheriffs in the New Wild West,/item/securing-online-advertising-rustlers-and-sheriffs-in-the-new-wild-west,07 Oct 2008,"Online advertising remains a ""Wild West"" where users are faced with ads they ought not believe and where firms overpay for ads without getting the results they were promised. But it doesn't have to be this way. Enforcement by public agencies is starting to remind advertisers and ad networks that long-standing consumer protection rules still apply online. And as advertisers become more sophisticated, they're less likely to tolerate opaque charges for services they can't confirm they received. During the past five years, Edelman has uncovered hundreds of online advertising scams defrauding thousands of users, including all the Web's top merchants. This chapter summarizes some of what he has found and what users and advertisers can do to protect themselves. Key concepts include: Advertising security gaps are widespread. Many companies don't view advertising fraud as a priority. Marketers often write off advertising fraud as an unavoidable cost of doing business. But effective fraud reduction can transform ""unavoidable"" losses into a bigger bottom-line and a real competitive advantage. Some advertisers compensate ad buyers in ways that discourage ad buyers from rooting out fraud. Furthermore, ad networks operate under mixed incentives in their supervision of partners, affiliates, and syndicators. Often, a marketer's partners and even its own staff have strong incentives to ignore problems rather than to take effective action.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising
1394,The Internalization of Advertising Services: An Inter-Industry Analysis,/item/the-internalization-of-advertising-services-an-inter-industry-analysis,18 Sep 2008,"When are advertisers more likely to establish and maintain their own in-house agencies? Despite occasional indications to the contrary, such self-sufficiency has long been viewed by industry observers and scholars as more the exception than the rule in the U.S. advertising and marketing services business. With the background that vertical integration in this industry is a neglected domain of research, analysis by HBS professor emeritus Alvin J. Silk and colleagues suggests that while most large U.S. advertisers rely primarily on independent agencies for advertising services, many other advertisers operate in-house advertising units. Key concepts include: The organization of the advertising and marketing services industry is likely to undergo considerable change as it absorbs new communication and information technologies, creating challenges and opportunities for both managers and researchers. In the 1990s, almost half of all U.S. advertisers, large and small, operated some form of in-house advertising unit. Smaller advertisers and advertisers of technical, creative, or highly differentiated products were more likely to integrate.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

Funny thing happened along the way, though: Now consumers are using the Internet to blunt traditional commercial messages. Time for companies to rethink their strategy, says HBS professor John A. Deighton. Key concepts include: In today's media-rich world, traditional advertising models are breaking down. Now, the consumer runs the show. Successful advertising campaigns today are self-parodying and spark discussions rather than blatantly sell products. As digital interactivity increases the contexts in which people use new media, it becomes less and less productive to think of people as consumers alone.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

Harvard Business School professor Stephen P. Bradley, who is cowriting a book on how broadband technologies are remaking many industries, discusses how advertising is responding to the challenges. Key concepts include: Traditional advertising vehicles such as television are becoming less interesting to advertisers because of fragmented viewership and inadequate user data. Broadband technology is becoming more important to advertisers because of its ability to move the consumer closer to a transaction decision and to deliver clearly segmented audiences. The advertising industry is wrestling with this transformation in part by merging with media companies and by launching creative ad alternatives.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

Professor John Quelch explains the advantages of this strategy when executed well, and tells how to recover from a real product shortage. Key concepts include: Marketers understand that using the illusion of scarcity can accelerate demand by encouraging us to buy sooner and perhaps to buy more than normal. Using false scarcity as a strategy also carries risk: it invites heightened scrutiny and frustrates buyers. Even if you experience a real product shortfall, take steps to mitigate potential disaster.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

Times have changed. From the Internet to store loyalty cards, technology has made the marketplace into an interactive exchange where the buyer is no longer anonymous. The future market will likely be one in which personal information is shared and leveraged. Consumers who are willing to share their information will be more attractive to sellers and more sought-after than those who have bad reputations or refuse to participate. Key concepts include: Consumers will play an increasingly leveraged role in the marketplace by ""branding"" themselves and sharing personal information with sellers. Technology is making the idea of consumer branding a reality, but it is unclear how personal information will be used in the marketplace, or which uses will be the most beneficial to both buyers and sellers. Look deeper into loyalty programs for the societal and commercial, and positive and negative effects of sharing personal information in the marketplace.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

Steenburgh explains why these seemingly contradictory results actually are complementary and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the investment's impact. Key concepts include: Combine the consumer and the competitive points of view for a more complete understanding of the marketing investment's impact.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.,Advertising

In the production process, the authors recommend risk management and portfolio management for studios, and explore talent compensation issues. Distribution trends show that box-office performance will increasingly depend on a small number of blockbusters, advertising spending will rise (but will cross different types of media), and the timing of releases (and DVDs) will become a bigger issue. As for exhibiting movies, trends show that more sophisticated exhibitors will emerge, contractual changes between distributor and exhibitors will change, and strategies for tickets prices may be reevaluated. Key concepts include: Business tools such as quantitative and qualitative research and market research should be applied to the decision-making process at earlier stages of development. Technological developments will continue to have unknown effects on every stage of the movie-making value chain (production, distribution, exhibition, consumption).Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

The authors use data on advertising expenditures and an online stock market simulation, The Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX), to track more than 280 movies released between 2001 and 2003. Their findings show that advertising affects the updating of market-wide expectations prior to release, and that this effect is stronger the higher the product quality. Key concepts include: Stock market simulations, such as the Hollywood Stock Exchange, can provide data on test markets, and provide clues about the quality of movies and the appeal of initial advertisements. Studios should spend less money on advertising low-quality movies.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Advertising

From the perspective of colleges competing for top applicants, how can these institutions make the best strategic decisions and increase their own desirability? South Korea offers an ideal case study for analyzing efficiency in college admissions matching because the national government sets the rules in centralized fashion and South Korea has made several important changes in the rules in 1994. The authors develop a model to study the incentives for colleges before and after the reforms, and compare the predictions of the model to stylized facts about the behavior of South Korean colleges given each set of rules. The authors then assess the success of the reforms before and after these changes to admissions rules. Findings show that the 1994 South Korean college admission reforms increased the efficiency of the assignment process in two ways. First, these reforms reduced congestion, ensuring that all students could apply to at least three highly-ranked colleges (once in early admissions and then on two different dates in regular admissions).

1455,Does Management Matter in Schools?,/item/does-management-matter-in-schools,09 Dec 2014,"There are major disparities in the quality of education within and across countries. School managerial practices may be one important reason for such differences, but research in this area has traditionally been held back by a lack of robust and comparable instruments to systematically measure management practices. In this paper the authors develop a novel and internationally comparable index of management quality for schools, and apply this methodology to measure management practices across 1,800 private and public schools across eight developed and developing economies. Three key findings emerged. First, the adoption of basic managerial practices varies significantly across and within countries. The United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada and the US obtain the highest average scores, followed by Germany, Italy and Brazil, while India has the lowest scores. Second, higher management scores are positively correlated with better pupil outcomes. Third, they show that that—similar to the private sector—different types of school governance are associated with systematically different levels of management adoption. Key concepts include: Management practices vary significantly across and within countries and are strongly linked to pupil outcomes. Among autonomous government schools, two key features account for a large fraction of the superior management performance of such schools: 1) having strong accountability of principals to an external governing body and 2) exercising strong leadership through a coherent long-term strategy for the school. Improving management could raise school standards and could give broad support for the fostering of greater autonomy of government schools. Autonomy by itself is unlikely to deliver better results. However, finding ways to improve governance and motivate principals could make sure that decentralized power leads to better standards.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

In addition, the mediated partnership model improved the knowledge produced as well as the collaborative behavior of scientists with a significantly higher level of citations and more cross-institutional coauthored publications. Key concepts include: Mediated public-private partnership funding affects firm performance especially in the mid-term, three to four years after funding. From a policy standpoint, by providing a public-private partnership funding scheme coupled with strong mediation, governments are able to incentivize firms to take on more basic science research and development and make the results more successful.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

Explaining differences in economic development today may hinge on understanding why most societies failed to develop adequate primary education in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This study sheds new light on the comparative experiences of Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC) during the formative years of their primary education systems. Key concepts include: Extreme decentralization in environments without democracy or accountability for local officials may lead to unequal educational outcomes within countries, as elites in certain provinces may choose to spend less on public goods, such as education. Brazil, Russia, India, and China were among the largest and poorest states in the world in the early twentieth century, and their low level of development limited investments in mass schooling. Brazil and Russia—marginally richer and possessing slightly broader forms of elite democracy—saw greater investments in public primary schooling than India and China. Central authorities in each BRIC country mostly absolved themselves of the responsibility of providing primary education. The provision of education was frequently decentralized to lower levels of government, where the absence of accountable and representative democracy allowed local elites to capture political institutions, limit redistributive taxation, and dictate how public resources were allocated. Variation among elites or in the political and economics conditions they faced (whether across space or over time) generated multiple schooling equilibriums across and within BRIC.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

1479,Salience in Quality Disclosure: Evidence from the U.S. News College Rankings,/item/salience-in-quality-disclosure-evidence-from-the-u-s-news-college-rankings,27 Sep 2011,"Why are the U.S. News and World Report College Rankings so influential? According to this paper by Michael Luca and Jonathan Smith, it's at least in part because U.S. News makes the information so simple. While earlier college guides had already provided useful information about schools, U.S. News did the work of aggregating the information into an easy-to-use ranking, making it more salient for prospective students. The authors show that these rankings matter in a big way: a one-rank improvement leads to a 0.9 percent increase in applicants. However, students tend to ignore the underlying details even though these details carry more information than the overall rank. Key concepts include: College applicants pay attention to a school's overall rank, rather than the more informative (but more complicated) underlying information. When U.S. News and World Report chooses how much weight to apply to different categories (such as faculty/student ratio and alumni giving rate), they are exerting a large amount of influence over students' application decisions. U.S. News presents many of these details, but it's the bottom line (i.e., the weights chosen by U.S. News) that matters. When deciding how to present information, managers should keep in mind that simple metrics are most effective. Providing detailed information to consumers may seem useful, but aggregate statistics (such as a ranking or grade) tend to have a larger impact on decision making.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

Kaplan. In this paper—in response to a newly minted professor who sought his advice—Kaplan reminds young scholars that accounting is more of a professional discipline than an academic subject. To that end, he advises them not just to teach their students the common body of accounting knowledge, but also to advance that body of knowledge by bridging the gap between scholarship and practice. Key concepts include: Accounting professors have a responsibility not just to dispense knowledge but also to advance it, especially in a time when the profession is changing rapidly. Risk management is a great issue for accounting academics to tackle. One, it is clearly relevant, due to the massive bank failures in the past few years. Two, it encompasses issues important to both academic study and professional practice-including reporting, disclosure, management control, and auditing. Young accounting professors should spend time teaching in executive education programs, which will give them an opportunity to get feedback from experienced professionals.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

Marion Fourcade (UC Berkeley) and Rakesh Khurana (HBS) analyze the changing place of economics in American business education as reflected in the teaching of three elite business schools over the course of the twentieth century: the Wharton School (1900-1930), the Carnegie Tech Graduate School of Industrial Administration (post World War II), and the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago (1960s-present). Key concepts include: Wharton is an illustration of the earliest trends and dilemmas, when business schools found themselves caught between their business connections and their striving for moral legitimacy in higher education. The Carnegie Tech Graduate School of Industrial Administration reflects a new vision, starting in the 1950s, of the contribution of business to society with the rise of ""management science""-a new formation that broke from the existing disciplinary system and sought to legitimatize itself through its hard-core technical capabilities. The University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business marks the decisive ascendancy of economics, and particularly financial economics, in business education over the other behavioral disciplines. This transformation helped produce and sustain new understandings of the nature of the firm, with far-reaching consequences for business practices and economic relations in society. Theories from each period provided a new language, and new categories of understanding and action, that not only became naturalized in the teachings of American business schools but also came to sustain and even instigate profound alterations in the nature of American corporations and markets-at least until the next series of tools, concepts, and business recipes came along.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

This paper adds organizational and exogenous perspective to existing theories by looking at the idea of ""dominating institutions""—a class of formal organizations purposively designed to change other institutions. HBS professor Rakesh Khurana and colleagues look at the Ford Foundation and its work reshaping America's graduate schools of management between 1952 and 1965 through funding of ""centers of excellence"" at a number of schools, including Harvard Business School. Key concepts include: The goal of this paper is to describe the structural characteristics and associated behaviors of dominating institutions, specifically the Ford Foundation, as they incite change within other institutions. Through its analysis and recommendations, the Ford Foundation reshaped America's graduate schools of management between 1952 and 1965 from a vocationally disparate, but ""successful"" field to a more academically and discipline-based orientation. The researchers anchor their work around two questions: What are the structural characteristics of a dominant institution? What key behaviors do dominant institutions use to allow them to significantly reshape an existing institution? The power of these institutions to change other institutions resided in their ability to broker personnel and practices across institutional sectors, elevating and legitimating particular practices, and providing resources in ways that increase the interdependence between the foundations and their beneficiaries. Large-scale institutional change does not occur in isolation, the findings suggest, but rather has to be understood in relation to what is happening in other institutional fields. Scholars studying institutional change should make an analytical distinction between the structure of the position of organizational actors in an institutional field and the interactions among the organizations in that field. Both are important in understanding the processes of institutional change.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

Q&A with Khurana, plus book excerpt. Key concepts include: Leadership as a phenomenon for research is experiencing a rebirth due to developments in the academy and the urgency of improving leadership globally. At the turn of the 20th century, leadership was studied intensely. It then fell off the academic grid. Given the number of schools asserting leadership development as part of their mission statement, it is critical for scholars to understand and explain how leaders succeed and fail based on opportunities and constraints.

And it certainly does not come from merely being in a leadership position or in a position of authority or having decision rights. This paper, the sixth of six pre-course reading assignments for an experimental leadership course developed by HBS professor emeritus Michael C. Jensen and coauthors, accompanies a course specifically designed to provide actionable access to being a leader and the effective exercise of leadership as one's natural self-expression. Key concepts include: One of the conditions for realizing the promise of the leadership course is that students must be open to examine, question, and then transform their worldviews (models of reality) and frames of reference (mindsets). Students create for themselves a powerful 4-part contextual framework that calls them into being as a leader. Having done this what remains is to confront one's own Ontological Perceptual and Functional constraints so as: 1) to relax their ability to restrict one's perceptions of what must be dealt with in any leadership situation, and 2) to relax their ability to restrict one's freedom of choice for action in any leadership situation. Students cannot master that which they do not create for themselves. This is especially true of anything that is at first counterintuitive.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

1491,"The Great Leap Forward: The Political Economy of Education in Brazil, 1889-1930",/item/the-great-leap-forward-the-political-economy-of-education-in-brazil-1889-1930,29 Apr 2010,"In 1890, with only 15 percent of the population literate, Brazil had the lowest literacy rate among the large economies in the Americas. Yet between 1890 and 1940, Brazil had the most rapid increase in literacy rates in the Americas, catching up with and even surpassing some of its more educated peers such as Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela. This jump in literacy was simultaneously accompanied by a brisk increase in the number of teachers, number of public schools, and enrollment rates. Why were political elites in Brazil willing to finance this expansion of public education for all? André Martínez-Fritscher of Banco de México, Aldo Musacchio of HBS, and Martina Viarengo of the London School of Economics explain how state governments secured funds to pay for education and examine the incentives of politicians to spend on education. They conclude that the progress made in education during these decades had mixed results in the long run. Key concepts include: Competition in national elections and a literacy requirement may have provided the right incentives for state political parties and state politicians to spend on education in a way that increased literacy rates in a significant way over the period studied. Brazil started from an extremely low base and ended in what today would be considered a low level of literacy as well (around 40 percent of the population). Between 1889 and 1930 there was significant progress in the provision of elementary education in Brazil. It was to a large extent a consequence of the fact that some states got more taxation powers and had the obligation to spend on public education. Positive trade shocks can be converted into long-term development if there is electoral competition, and economic assets are not concentrated in a few hands. Expenditures on education between 1889 and 1930 altered the development path of some states and changed their relative rankings compared to other states in a somewhat permanent way.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education
1492,Investing in Improvement: Strategy and Resource Allocation in Public School Districts,/item/investing-in-improvement-strategy-and-resource-allocation-in-public-school-districts,10 Feb 2010,"The operating environments of public school districts are largely void of the market forces that reward a company's success with more capital and exert pressure on it to eventually abandon unproductive activities. Stacey Childress describes the strategic resource decisions in 3 of the 20 public school districts that she and colleagues have studied through the Public Education Leadership Project at Harvard. The stories in San Francisco, New York City, and Maryland's Montgomery County occurred largely before the districts faced dramatic decreases in revenues, though they show the superintendents facing budget concerns near the end of the narratives. Even so, the situations share common principles that superintendents and their leadership teams can use to make differentiated resource decisions—reducing spending in some areas and increasing it in others with a clear rationale for why these decisions will produce results for students. Key concepts include: Given the rarity of strategic approaches to resource allocation described in the examples, it is clear that district leaders need more guidance and tools to help them make better decisions and manage the consequences, particularly when they are under enormous fiscal pressure. Back your strategy with a resource plan—otherwise it is not a strategy. Don't get trapped by the dogma of decentralization. If leaders alienate influential stakeholders when budgets are flush, it will be even more difficult to preserve key strategic investments during financial crises.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

1498,"Demographics, Career Concerns or Social Comparison: Who Games SSRN Download Counts?",/item/demographics-career-concerns-or-social-comparison-who-games-ssrn-download-counts,25 Mar 2009,"Why do certain individuals commit fraudulent acts—in this case repeatedly downloading their own working papers from the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) repository to increase the papers' reported download counts? HBS professors Benjamin G. Edelman and Ian I. Larkin study the relative importance of demographic, economic, and psychological factors leading individuals to commit this kind of gaming. Authors engage in deceptive self-downloading to improve a paper's visibility on SSRN, to obtain more favorable assessments of paper quality, and to obtain possible benefits for promotion and tenure decisions at those schools that consider download counts in tenure decisions. Data indicates that authors are more likely to inflate their papers' download counts when a higher count greatly improves the visibility of a paper on the SSRN network. Authors are also more likely to inflate their papers' download counts when their peers recently had successful papers—suggesting an ""envy"" effect in download gaming. Download inflations are also affected somewhat by career concerns (e.g. just before changing jobs) and by demographic factors, though these effects are smaller. On the whole, analysis suggests a heightened risk of fraudulent acts not only where economic returns are high, but also where prestige, status, or reputation are important. Key concepts include: Envy and social comparisons play a strong role in predicting deceptive downloads. Discontinuities and other incentive anomalies invite gaming. At SSRN, gaming increases when it will increase a paper's visibility on SSRN by putting the paper (or keeping it) on a ""Top 10 list."" Some groups seem to be less likely to engage in download gaming. Females and researchers at low-ranked institutions seem to be somewhat less likely to engage in gaming.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education
1499,"Smart Money: The Effect of Education, Cognitive Ability, and Financial Literacy on Financial Market Participation",/item/smart-money-the-effect-of-education-cognitive-ability-and-financial-literacy-on-financial-market-participation,14 Jan 2009,"(Previously titled ""If You Are So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich? The Effects of Education, Financial Literacy and Cognitive Ability on Financial Market Participation."") Individuals face an increasingly complex menu of financial product choices. The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pension plans, and the growing importance of private retirement accounts, require individuals to choose the amount they save, as well as the mix of assets in which they invest. Yet, participation in financial markets is far from universal in the United States. Moreover, researchers have only a limited understanding of what factors cause participation. Cole and Shastry use a very large dataset new to the literature in order to study the important determinants of financial market participation. They find that higher levels of education and cognitive ability cause increased participation—however, financial literacy education does not. Key concepts include: The relationship between education and savings is difficult to measure, because both are affected by many factors (motivation, ability, etc.). This paper documents an important causal relationship between education and financial market participation. A set of financial literacy education programs, mandated by state governments, did not have an effect on individual savings decisions. It is imperative to conduct rigorous evaluations of financial literacy education programs to measure their efficacy.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

1502,Secrets of the Academy: The Drivers of University Endowment Success,/item/secrets-of-the-academy-the-drivers-of-university-endowment-success,17 Sep 2008,"University endowments are important and interesting institutions both in the investing community and society at large. They play a role in maintaining the academic excellence of many universities that rely heavily on income from their endowments. In contrast, poor finances can undermine a school's ability to provide academic services altogether. Endowments have also received much attention recently for their superior investment returns compared with other institutional investors. In this study, the authors document the trends in college and university endowment returns and investments in the United States between 1992 and 2005. Key concepts include: Many unanswered questions remain about university endowments. Results suggest that endowment sizes are skewed, with the rich universities getting richer while other schools fall behind. Much of the growth in endowment size has been driven by investment performance. The top endowments posted impressive returns in 2005, averaging a net real return of 12.3 percent compared with 4.4 percent posted by the Standard & Poor's 500 index in the same year. Across endowments, institutional characteristics such as endowment size and admissions selectivity are better predictors of success than the allocation to risky asset classes. Moreover, top endowments seem to possess superior asset selection ability beyond their strategies for allocating funds to certain asset classes. Ordinary investors could not necessarily achieve similar results by mimicking the strategies of top endowments. Indeed, the same strategies that have worked so well for the endowments in the past two decades may not do so in the future.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

Childress. She explains what New Orleans represents for entrepreneurial opportunities in U.S. public education. Key concepts include: Charter schools are public schools of choice that operate outside the governance and policies of their local school districts. Prior to the hurricane, the New Orleans school district was one of the worst in the country. Today no other large school district in the United States has such a high percentage of charter schools as does New Orleans. The organization New Schools for New Orleans (NSNO), the subject of an HBS case study, aims to create networks of schools to receive shared support services while avoiding the dysfunctions of a large urban district. NSNO developed a strategy to focus on a subset of charter schools that it believed could be helped most. Was it the right strategy?

1508,Incompatible Assumptions: Barriers to Producing Multidisciplinary Knowledge in Communities of Scholarship,/item/incompatible-assumptions-barriers-to-producing-multidisciplinary-knowledge-in-communities-of-scholarship,25 Mar 2008,"Just as flows of knowledge within and across communities of practice improve the quality of new products, knowledge sharing among knowledge workers within interdisciplinary communities may be critical for new discoveries and for a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of phenomena. In spite of this, biologists tend to talk to biologists, economists tend to talk to economists, and lawyers tend to talk to lawyers. This paper argues that producing and disseminating knowledge within a multidisciplinary community of practice is enhanced when knowledge workers hold compatible assumptions, even when the form and content of knowledge generation across those workers varies. Key concepts include: Generating multidisciplinary knowledge may require communities of scholarship to acknowledge the presence and limitations of their assumptions. Within a community of scholarship, interpretive barriers to sharing knowledge arise when subgroups hold contrary assumptions about the appropriate questions to be asked or the fundamental nature of the phenomenon under investigation. Cross-discipline understanding may stem from the potential for members to recognize the relevance of others' findings to their own scholarship.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Education

For decades, the Government of India, like most governments in the developing world, has operated a system of agricultural extension, intended to spread information on new agricultural practices and technologies through a large work force of public extension agents. Evidence of the efficacy of these extension services, however, is limited. This paper describes a randomized field experiment examining the potential for an alternate route to improving agricultural management. Specifically, the authors evaluate Avaaj Otalo (AO), a mobile phone-based technology that allows farmers to call a hotline, ask questions, and receive responses from agricultural scientists and local extension workers. Findings show that AO had a range of important, positive effects on farmer behavior. This paper may be the first rigorous evaluation of mobile phone-based extension and, more generally, the first evaluation of a demand-driven extension service delivered by any means. Key concepts include: Farmers with access to the service were more likely to switch to a pesticide that is both more effective against pests, and dramatically less toxic to humans. Farmers receiving advice were also quicker to adopt high-value cash crops, planting more cumin and demonstrating more knowledge about it. The paper presents the first rigorous evidence that a low-cost agricultural extension service (costing as little as $.60 per farmer per month) can change behavior. There is a ""digital divide"" in India. There are systematic differences in adoption and use of the service, even among a relatively homogeneous group of farmers, and even for a technology that was specifically designed to be accessible to an illiterate population. Surveying by mobile phones can be conducted effectively and cheaply in a developing country context. There is considerable demand among farmers for high quality agricultural information. The information and communications technology (ICT) delivered timely, relevant, and actionable information and advice to farmers at dramatically lower cost than any traditional service. The ICT significantly changed farmers' sources of information for sowing and input-related decisions-in particular, farmers relied less on commissions-motivated agricultural input dealers for pesticide advice.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Agriculture and Agribusiness

1535,Poultry in Motion: A Study of International Trade Finance Practices,/item/poultry-in-motion-a-study-of-international-trade-finance-practices,15 Jul 2011,"When engaging in international trade, exporters must decide which financing terms to use in their transactions. Should they ask the importers to pay for goods before they are loaded for shipment, ask them to pay after the goods have arrived at their destination, or should they use some form of bank intermediation like a letter of credit? In this paper, Pol Antràs and C. Fritz Foley investigate this question by analyzing detailed data on the activities of a single US-based firm that exports frozen and refrigerated food products, primarily poultry. The data cover roughly $7 billion in sales to more than 140 countries over the 1996-2009 period and contain comprehensive information on the financing terms used in each transaction. Key concepts include: Firms that are likely to have the highest costs of obtaining external capital tend to be the ones that need it most. Importers are more likely to transact on cash in advance terms when they are based in countries with weak institutions, and external capital also tends to be particularly expensive in these countries. Firms in weak institutional environments are able to overcome the constraints of such environments if they can establish a relationship with their trading partners. As a relationship develops between trading partners, concerns about weak institutions seem to subside, and transactions are more likely to occur on terms that allow payment after goods have arrived. The manner in which trade is financed shapes the impact of macroeconomic and financial crises such as the recent one. For instance, the data show that importers who were transacting on cash in advance terms before the recent crisis reduced their purchases the most.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Agriculture and Agribusiness

1568,"Housing Collateral, Credit Constraints, and Entrepreneurship-Evidence from a Mortgage Reform",/item/housing-collateral-credit-constraints-and-entrepreneurship-evidence-from-a-mortgage-reform,30 Oct 2014,"One of the strongest findings in studies of entrepreneurship is the clear positive correlation between personal wealth and the propensity to engage in entrepreneurship. One study, for example, has shown that entrepreneurs comprise just under 9 percent of households in the United States, but hold about 40 percent of total net worth. The most common explanation for this correlation is that credit constraints pose an important barrier to entry for less wealthy individuals. However, others have questioned the degree to which financing constraints are barriers to entrepreneurship, particularly in advanced economies where firms have adequate access to capital. In this paper, the authors consider a unique mortgage reform in Denmark to study how increasing access to credit through the unlocking of housing collateral for personal loans had an impact on entrepreneurship. Findings show that the reform affected the ability to draw on debt backed by home equity. However, despite the positive and statistically significant effect of relaxing credit constraints on entrepreneurship, the magnitudes are small. Furthermore, an important reason for the small magnitude was that the marginal business founded by those who benefited from the reform was of lower quality, where the new entrants failed within two years of entry. Overall, the results paint a more nuanced picture of the extent to which financing constraints are important in settings with well-developed credit markets, and the role that home equity can play in alleviating these. Key concepts include: Findings address the longstanding question of the importance of credit constraints for entrepreneurship. Housing collateral shifts the bank's adjudication decision from a specific project to the creditworthiness of the borrower. On the one hand, good entrepreneurial projects may be able to be started or sustained. On the other hand, though, optimistic entrepreneurs may start lower quality businesses because they do not face the same discipline from the bank.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Construction

1570,Digital Discrimination: The Case of Airbnb.com,/item/digital-discrimination-the-case-of-airbnb-com,28 Jan 2014,"To build trust and facilitate transactions, online marketplaces present information not only about products, but also about the people offering the products. Many platforms now allow sellers to present personal profiles, post pictures of themselves, and even link to their Facebook accounts. While these features serve the laudable goals of building trust and accountability, they can also bring unintended consequences: Personal profiles may facilitate discrimination. Benjamin G. Edelman and Michael Luca investigate the extent of racial discrimination against hosts on the popular online rental marketplace Airbnb.com. They construct a data set combining pictures of all New York City landlords on Airbnb with their rental prices and information about characteristics and quality of their properties. The authors use this data to measure differences in outcomes according to host race. Nonblack hosts are able to charge approximately 12 percent more than black hosts, holding location, rental characteristics, and quality constant. Moreover, black hosts receive a larger price penalty for having a poor location relative to nonblack hosts. These differences highlight the risk of discrimination in online marketplaces, suggesting an important unintended consequence of a seemingly-routine mechanism for building trust. Key concepts include: Online marketplaces have the potential to reduce discrimination by facilitating more arms-length transactions. However, social platforms such as Airbnb.com, a popular online marketplace for short-term rentals, may have the opposite effect. This paper investigates the differences in prices of properties from hosts of varying races. Non-black hosts charge approximately 12% more than black hosts for comparable properties. Online marketplaces should think carefully about whether, and why, the looks of buyers and sellers should be relevant to the purchase at hand. Airbnb might consider eliminating or reducing the prominence of host photos. It is not clear what beneficial information these photos provide, while they risk facilitating discrimination by guests.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Construction

1584,Systemic Risk and the Refinancing Ratchet Effect,/item/systemic-risk-and-the-refinancing-ratchet-effect,01 Oct 2009,"During periods of rising house prices, falling interest rates, and increasingly competitive and efficient refinancing markets, cash-out refinancing is like a ratchet, incrementally increasing homeowner debt as real-estate values appreciate without the ability to symmetrically decrease debt by increments as real-estate values decline. This paper suggests that systemic risk in the housing and mortgage markets can arise quite naturally from the confluence of these three apparently salutary economic trends. Using a numerical simulation of the U.S. mortgage market, the researchers show that the ratchet effect is capable of generating the magnitude of losses suffered by mortgage lenders during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. These observations have important implications for risk management practices and regulatory reform. Key concepts include: Consider the hypothetical scenario in which all homeowners decide to refinance and extract cash from any accumulated house equity so that their loan-to-value ratio is kept the same as the one for a new purchaser of that house. Suppose that the refinancing market is so competitive, i.e., refinancing costs are so low and capital is so plentiful, that homeowners can implement this refinancing each month. In this extreme case, during periods of rising home prices and falling interest rates, cash-out refinancing has the same risk effect ""as if"" all houses had been purchased and their mortgages originated at the peak of the housing market, thereby creating a large systemic risk exposure. Then, when home prices fall, the refinancing ratchet ""locks,'' causing a systemic event with widespread correlated defaults and large losses for mortgage lenders. While excessive risk-taking, overly aggressive lending practices, pro-cyclical regulations, and political pressures surely contributed to the recent problems in the U.S. housing market, the simulations show that even if all homeowners, lenders, investors, insurers, rating agencies, regulators, and policymakers behaved rationally, ethically, and with the purest of motives, financial crises can still occur. The fact that the refinancing ratchet effect arises only when three market conditions are simultaneously satisfied demonstrates that the current financial crisis is subtle, and may not be attributable to a single cause. There may be no easy legislative or regulatory solutions: Lower interest rates, higher home prices, and easier access to mortgage loans have appeared separately in various political platforms and government policy objectives over the years. Their role in fostering economic growth makes it virtually impossible to address the refinancing ratchet effect within the current regulatory framework. We need an independent organization devoted solely to the study, measurement, and public notification of systemic risk, not unlike the role that the National Transportation Safety Board plays with respect to airplane crashes, train wrecks, and highway accidents. The subtle and multifaceted nature of the refinancing ratchet effect is just one example of the much broader challenge of defining, measuring, and managing systemic risk in the financial system.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Construction

Key concepts include: It is time to recalibrate the country's access to credit. Tight credit threatens to shut the safety valve of the low-wage sector of the economy.

Mandatory IFRS adoption has been criticized for both the flexibility afforded under the standards and the encroachment of the fair value paradigm. Specifically, common accounting standards alone may not be sufficient to provide the benefits of common accounting practices. This paper examines the causes and consequences of different forms of fair value disclosures for tangible long-lived assets. Insights may assist standard setters and users in understanding the factors influencing firms' current and future accounting choices, and may also interest U.S. standard setters and managers of the almost 250 publicly traded U.S. real estate firms. Key concepts include: Investors believe that investment property fair values are reliable enough to warrant a significantly lower cost of capital for those firms providing them. The demand for fair value information (reflected in a firm's ownership structure) and the firm's commitment to reporting transparency is associated with the decision to provide fair values. Critically, adoption of this fair value standard under IFRS, in and of itself, is insufficient to fully overcome previous perceived reporting differences across these firms. This is consistent with investors perceiving that property firms across EU countries vary in how they implement this standard.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Construction

Key concepts include: The Treasury proposal recognizes that fundamental change in the regulatory structure is required for managing risk in the financial system. The difficulty with the approach is that the risk in the financial system will not disappear—it will simply move to the non-prudentially regulated firms.

1618,"Management Practices, Relational Contracts, and the Decline of General Motors",/item/management-practices-relational-contracts-and-the-decline-of-general-motors,12 Feb 2014,"What led to General Motors' decline? Long regarded as one of the best managed and most successful firms in the world, its share of the US market fell from 62.6 to 19.8 percent between 1980 and 2009, and in 2009 the firm went bankrupt. The authors argue that the conventional explanations for GM's decline are seriously incomplete. They discuss a number of causes for the firm's difficulties, and make the case that one of the reasons that GM began to struggle was because rival Toyota's practices were rooted in the widespread deployment of effective relational contracts--agreements based on subjective measures of performance that could neither be fully specified beforehand nor verified after the fact and that were thus enforced by the shadow of the future. GM's history, organizational structure, and managerial practices made it very difficult to maintain these kinds of agreements either within the firm or between the firm and its suppliers. The authors also argue that at least two aspects of GM's experience seem common to a wide range of firms. First, past success often led to extended periods of denial: Indeed a pattern of denial following extended success appears to be a worldwide phenomenon. Second, many large American manufacturers had difficulty adopting the bundle of practices pioneered by firms like Toyota. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this history for efforts to revive American manufacturing. Key concepts include: Public support for economic growth has usually focused on the diffusion of technology-based insights. Learning more about when (and what type of) relational contracts are likely to be valuable may be just as important. For General Motors, the historical success of the firm led its senior managers to deny and/or misperceive the nature of the threat presented by Japanese competition for much of the 1970s and 1980s. GM faced difficulties in the 1990s once the firm had made the decision to adopt Toyota's managerial practices. It took time for GM to understand exactly what Toyota was doing. Then problems in building new relational contracts greatly slowed GM's efforts to respond effectively, either through innovation or by imitating Toyota's efforts.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Auto

Toffel and colleagues. Case in point: service stations that cheat on auto emissions testing. Key concepts include: Vehicle owners are less likely to return to a service facility that has failed their vehicle in an auto emissions test. Vehicles were much more likely to pass the test if they were tested at a facility that was located near a competitor. Managers should be aware that fostering a culture of intense competition may instead induce unethical behavior.Closed for comment; 10 Comment(s) posted.",Auto
1623,Customer-Driven Misconduct: How Competition Corrupts Business Practices,/item/customer-driven-misconduct-how-competition-corrupts-business-practices,08 Mar 2012,"Competition is typically thought to generate many positive outcomes including lower prices and higher productivity. But competition can also lead firms to increase quality for their customers in ways that are both illegal and socially costly. This paper examines the impact of competition on the vehicle emissions testing market, and finds that firm misconduct increases with competitive pressure and the threat of losing customers to rival firms. These results have serious implications for policy makers and managers. This paper is among the first to empirically demonstrate that increased competition can motivate firms to provide illicit quality to avoid losing business. Key concepts include: Firms seeking to enforce legal and ethical conduct among managers and employees must be especially vigilant when operating in highly competitive markets. Increased competition within markets may encourage competitors to cross legal boundaries in ways that threaten the profits of legally compliant firms. In the absence of effective monitoring by government institutions, firms may benefit from privately monitoring their competitors' behavior to ensure that rivals do not maintain a competitive advantage through illicit actions. Policy makers must carefully consider the optimal market structure for industries in which illicit actions yield cost reductions or are demanded by customers. While competition may yield lower prices and better choice for customers, it may also bring the increased social costs of illegal behavior by firms. Since managers may be under considerable pressure to cross legal and ethical lines when market competition is high, avoiding government sanctions requires top managers and owners to strengthen monitoring and governance mechanisms to ensure legal compliance. Managers must understand that government policy, firm decisions, or exogenous factors that increase market rivalry may necessitate the monitoring of competitors' behavior. The failure to do so may allow these rivals to gain advantage through illicit strategies, particularly under institutional regimes where regulatory monitoring or enforcement is weak.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Auto

For starters, they need to improve their auto lineups for the long term. He explains how Ford and GM can best navigate the industry landscape ahead. Key concepts include: For U.S. automakers to accelerate production while Toyota remains wounded is not a long-term strategy for success. The companies should cut costs while simultaneously transforming their organizations and revamping product lineups. Ford and GM could secure market share gains by investing windfall profits into making products more competitive for the next decade. In this regard, Ford has the jump on GM.

Key concepts include: Toyota Motor Corporation's problem is first and foremost a leadership crisis. It needs a credible leader with a strong, cohesive plan. Competitors Ford and GM are working to regain the market share they have lost to Toyota. Rather than blame floor mats and panicky drivers, as Toyota did when complaints first arose, it should have acknowledged that its vaunted quality system failed.

1630,Measuring and Understanding Hierarchy as an Architectural Element in Industry Sectors,/item/measuring-and-understanding-hierarchy-as-an-architectural-element-in-industry-sectors,27 Aug 2009,"In an industry setting, classic supply chains display strict hierarchy, whereas clusters of firms have linkages going in many different directions. Previous theory has often assumed the existence of the hierarchical relationships among firms, and empirical industry studies tend to focus on a single-layer industry, or a two-layer structure comprising buyers and suppliers. And yet, some industries have a multilayer structure with a multistep supply chain. Others comprise a cluster of complementary firms producing different parts of a large system. HBS professor Carliss Y. Baldwin and colleagues use network analysis to study multilayer industries both empirically (in the case of Japan) and theoretically and to explore how industries are organized at the sector level in an attempt to reveal the underlying rules that determine how industry architectures form and change. Key concepts include: Empirical analysis shows that the automotive sector in Japan exhibits a significantly higher degree of hierarchy and higher transaction breadth (average number of customers per firm) than the electronics sector. The degree of hierarchy in an industry sector may be traced back to fundamental properties of the underlying technologies. This research helps points the way to new approaches for understanding industry architectures and the factors that influence the architecture of industry sectors.Closed for comment; 0 Comment(s) posted.",Auto

The promotion stole largely from future sales with taxpayers subsidizing over half a million new car sales that would have occurred anyway.
